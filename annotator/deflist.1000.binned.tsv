Groutfiti|||A form of graffiti. It involves writing in the tiny space of grout in between tiles in public toilets. The phrases always are made up of some pun using the word grout. Other examples include movie titles, like "The grout, the bad, and the ugly" or simple words, like "groutrageous." This type of graffiti has no deep meaning, but it is a great example of intellectual fun. It makes sense that it exists primarily around Universities where people are intelligent, yet very young and therefore still trying to amuse themselves and others by doing things like writing on walls. It all starts when one person makes one of these grout puns and it is seen by another student who, while urinating, who then thinks of another pun and writes it on another section of grout. Soon the "groutfiti" spreads and people spontaneously think of puns while pissing.|||"Thrre stikes and you're grout""The Grout Gatsby""The Grout Barrier Reef""The Groutain of Youth"|||2997,6093

From the Greek 'Paedo' which means 'Child' and 'Phile' which means 'Love'A sexual orientation that has been demonized and criminalized for centuries. It is simply having a romantic, physical and sexual attraction towards children. It has been heavily misused to compare pedophiles with child molestors.

spider|||One of evolution's greatest success stories.  There are spiders all over the world, and the oldest known fossil spider is 380 million years old.  Spiders are eight-legged and carnivorous, use silk in a variety of ways depending on the species.  Many spin cobwebs to catch prey, larger spiders line the edge of their burrows with web.  The bolas spider is named because it throws a line of web ending in a sticky lump to catch prey.  Spiders inspire fear and revulsion, quite undeserved, but probably not helped by years of movies telling us spiders are humanity's enemies.  Schools are not much more helpful.  I still remember a science teacher telling us a black widow was the size of a human hand, which is rubbish.  There are some dangerously venomous spiders, like widow spiders, funnelweb spiders, brown recluse spiders and brazilian wandering spiders, but they are a tiny minority of the huge number of spiders in the world.  Just to drag some widely-held beliefs into the light of reality:1: Spiders are not watching you.  Most, apart from some jumping spiders, have very poor eyesight.2: Spiders do not come out of plug-holes.  A spider in the bath has fallen down there and can't get out due to the bath's slippery sides.3: Large hairy spiders are not automatically dangerous.  In fact nobody has ever died from a tarantula bite.4: Women are not automatically scared of spiders.  In fact most of the calls the British Tarantula Society gets regarding fear of spiders are from worried men.|||Hysterical person: Help!  I saw a spider!  I'm not going to bed!  It might be there waiting for me!Other person: What makes you think any self-respecting spiders would want to get into your bed?|||289,128

A skillet made of cast iron||||||295,146
spider|||1: noun- Extremely frightening members of the arachnid family, spiders can be found all over the world. These creatures are eight-legged and carnivorous and most often use silk/webbing to ensnare and bind their prey. Venom is then injected into the incapacitated victim, which pretty much liquefies its insides so that the spider can drink it. Yum. Some of them just do some creepy attack shit, though... with, like... jumping and strength and evil. Some spider venom is harmful to humans as well as insects. And while spiders are found in almost every corner of the globe, it seems that they are all conspiring to scare me individually.  I'm pretty sure at this point that they exist to make me cry. 2: verb- When there is only one swing set on a playground but two individuals wish to swing at the same time, they may choose to spider. One of them, usually the larger, sits forward (normally) on the seat of the swing, and the other straddles that person, facing towards them.|||1: Spiders scare the living fuck out of me. Fear of spiders is known as arachnophobia, and can make you extremely paranoid in more intense cases. 2: In sixth grade, Alicia and Betty decided to swing while they were waiting for the bus to come.

Blonde|||A hair color sometimes associated with unintelligence when in fact intelligence is not affected noticeably by hair color.|||She's blonde...who cares?|||4083,1451
Blonde|||A hair color that's a light gold color, and is usually associated with ditziness and stupidity. Usually they're just as smart as people  with other hair colors,  but some of them act dumb because they think the whole "dumb blonde" thing is cute or something. They're not necessarily prettier than brunettes or other hair colors, but some of them put extra effort into makeup, fashion and weight control because of what society expects of blondes. Hair color is entirely superficial, and it's extremely shallow to judge entirely on a physical feature that can be changed as easy as hair color. Certainly some blondes are ditzy and stupid, but so can anyone. Let their personality speak for itself, not their hair.|||As a brunette, I haven't noticed any correlation between blondes and ditziness at my school. Some of them are even at the top of our class.|||2871,862
Blonde|||It's a hair colour (gold, usually), NOT a personality trait. The dumb blonde cliché started with the kinds of characters Marylin Monroe played in many of her movies.

So when people blame their ditsiness or naivety on being blonde, they are just pandering to a popular culture stereotype. In other words, being blonde has nothing to do with being stupid.  Being stupid has everything to do with being stupid.|||Marylin Monroe's character, at the end of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, convinces her would-be father-in-law that women chasing after rich men is like men chasing after beautiful women.|||1460,624

posh|||The word means rich, aristocratic, wealthy, loaded, fancy, toff, toffee nosed, upper crust, well off, or well to do. The origin of this word actually derives from an old Romany Gypsy slang word for pennies, i.e. if you've a lot of pennies you're well to do, rich, etc. In this light, the word posh can be used as a term of light hearted derision. Please note: a wrong but often repeated even on this website is the urban myth is that the word POSH orginated from Port Out Starboard Home - based on based on the  position of the more expensive cabins on a passenger ships from England to India - but this is actually nonesense whch has been commonly repeated.|||She looks really posh with that new pearl necklace.

posh|||A popular definition seems to be that P.O.S.H was printed on tickets for P&O cruise ships in the early 20th century leaving India. These tickets were for the more desirable rooms which put you on the Port side going out and the Starboard side returning home as it kept you out of the sun and kept the room cool. However, no tickets have ever been found which had P.O.S.H on the ticket. Sources: www.wikipedia.orgwww.askoxford.com                                    www.phrases.org.uk I suggest that the mistake has been made from the full name of the Cruise Liner: Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Maybe a printing error produced P.O.S.H rather than P.O.S.N.C A more factual defintion still derives from a shipping term which does not seem to be suggested on the previous source sites. When boats leave a harbour the shipping lanes work to the rule that you must stay to the left hand side like on U.K roads. When leaving a harbour you therefore keep the Port lights of the shipping lane on the left and the Starboard on the right. However, when returning you keep the starboard lights on the left and the Port lights on the right. Hence Port Out Starboard Home... P.O.S.H|||Salcombe Harbour uses this Port Out Starboard Home or p.o.s.h. principle.|||31,35

Neston Colliery (Closed in 1927) - A particular Foreman at the colliery was said to have chose the men he wanted to work on a daily basis by pointing to each man and stating 'You Sir' - So it allegedly became somewhat of a joke and subsequent use of the two words combined was borne. NB. 'Youser' is one of two words (also 'owden) used to describe a true native of Neston or the surrounding areas2. Deer Hunting - It is said that when deer hunting took place in Parkgate and the surrounding area, the working parties would greet the hunters/gentlemen with 'Good morning Sir' and were greeted back with 'And to you, Sir' or vice versa or possibly even just between the hunters/gentlemen.

China|||One of the oldest countries in the world, it has a rich cultural history extending back roughly 5 or 6 millenia.  The Xia dynasty were the first real royal line, overthrown by the Shang dynasty, who were, in turn, ousted in a revolution by the Zhou (pronounced 'show').  Gradually, China expanded, and with the discovery of tea, a rich cultre developed.  It fostered the development of the Daoist religion as well as Confucianism, named after its founder.  Once invaded by Mongolia, China found true prosperity under the wise rule of Kublai Khan.  By the 1800s, China was probably the most advanced nation on the planet, with public libraries, schools and plentiful resources.  However, after the population boom and following colonial conquests, China lost its Emperor in 1919.  A nationalist leadership was set up, lasting through WW2 until, in 1949, Mao Tse-Tung overthrew it, creating the communist dictatorship we all know today.|||China is responsible for such wonders as the Terracotta Army and the birth of Confucianism.|||2657,1753
China|||emerging superpower in the 21st century.  A country with a 5000yr old history, and has been existence as divided longer than as unified.  Rich culture that has influenced Japan, Korea. Ruled by the communist party of china, though it retains very little remnants of true communism/socialism.  Very safe country as there are no firearms allowed and very extreme punishment to deter potential offenders.  PPl who commit rape, murder, grand theft, extortion, and corruption are often summarily executed within 6 months with a single bullet to the brain stem.  Great way of detering crime, imo.  The ppl are nice, although many have a hatred for Japan because of her atrocities in WWII and the sino-japanese war, and because the japanese omitt these atrocities from their textbooks.   Although economy is improving, the poor are getting poorer and the rich, richer. Most Chinese people tend not to protest government for it may cause them trouble.  But there is a deep sense of nationalism in the Chinese. Has gotten alot of heat along w/ North Korea for its questionable human rights practices;  although we should not forget the fact that taiwan and South Korea only became democracies in the 1990s and have their own fair share of human rights abuses.  After the events of 1989, the PRC has chosen to reform slowly and cautiously. The most sensitive issue is taiwan.  China had orginally planned to occupy it in 1950s but was soon committed to the Korean War.  Chinese politicians and citizens are adamant at taking over taiwan in the near future.  Many experts see a pattern in that while taiwan is China's pet peeve, North Korea is USA's pet peeve and both are using their leverage w/ said nations to achieve their own goals. The chinese people and culture are not warmongers, though.  They crave peace, growth, and prosperity.  To demonstrate their seriousness, when a US official stated that the US would defend Taiwan,  a senior Chinese PLA General stated that the PRC would not hesitate to use Nuclear Weapons agains the USA.  They are even willing to forgo the '08 Olympics to have the issue of Taiwan take precedence.

China|||A nation of vast culture and unprecedented potential.China unlike America has used their brains to figure out that war rarely gets you what you want.  China has committed to bettering its own people through economic rejuvenation. Not conquer and conquest, like ah, the American gov. In fact China took the time to inform the world of its intentions and that it does not want the world to perceive China as a threat. China created a doctrine and announced it to the world. It is a foreign policy doctrine created by the People's Republic of China in the early 21st century. It addresses concerns the world may have about its strengthening global position. Quote: "The term (China's peaceful rise)is used primarily to reassure the nations of Asia and the United States that the rise of the PRC in military and economic prominence will not pose a threat to peace and stability, and that other nations will benefit from PRC's rising power and influence. Explicit in the doctrine, is the notion that PRC's economic and military development is not a zero-sum game and that China is less of an economic competitor than an economic opportunity"  Fearful westerners may not be comforted by this; but China which is much much older than America, does not have an aggressive past. It is the great defender, and even in defense it showed its enemies mercy, declining to conquer attacking enemies, in some defensive battles, china pushed the opposing army all the way back to their capital city, and after winning, left and returned the their own land saying "There you see now, leave us alone, and we will leave you alone, this is your lesson." Demonstrating its actions were only to deter an attacking nation. Never to conquer. Which is a big statement coming from a nation with the largest population (and therefore largest potential army) and the inventor/discoverer of gun powder. Secondly, china is not stupid enough to think countries can benefit from war.  Look at the world, the highest living standards belong to the most peaceful countries. America (by the way I don't hate America, I like America, I just hate the governments foreign policy, and domestic is not that great either). Is supposedly the richest country in the world, ok so why are so many people poor in America? Because the politicians want to spend money playing with their war machines, instead of spending in their own country helping their own people. If America put all the money they have spend on the Iraq war, into their own country, in say, ohh I don't know, education programs, career programs, scholarships; rebuilding the ghettos of America and doing something for their poor, and not being such pricks to the world, than maybe people would have a little more admiration for them. If they invested  all the money they have spent killing people over oil, and instead invested it in alternative fuels, and technologies, they would have a feasible alternative right now. It's not that hard, we all know theirs alternatives. Instead the gov has opted to destroy the world for their own benefit, it's been done guys, try something new already...|||As china advances its economy they will improve life for all it's people, they have already started. They have a lot on their plate, they are starting to realized now the need for environmental protection.  And that they can't just leave the poor behind. As well they have already realized the need for cutting back energy consumption, and the persuit of alternative energy sources. It will take time, but I believe that China my soon become the beacon in the darkness of the world, as one that acheived greatness and prosperity; peacfully, fully, and fairly.

rp|||Roleplaying. An interactive social activity for people with the ability to write and improvise. Sadly, roleplaying is being invaded by people who can't write OR improvise OR follow common rules of etiquette. By the way, roleplaying is a game. Anyone who thinks that it relates directly to real life any more than, say, Crazy Eights does might want to have their head examined.|||"I'm going to go RP with my friends." "I'm bored... let's RP."|||826,291
rp|||Short version, it's two or more people writing a story together. Here's the long version: RP stands for Role Play. It's a type of writing which usually happens between two or more people, and it is notoriously hard to finish a single story before starting a new one. Each person takes on one central character as their character, and then accepts responsibilities for several or many others, depending on how many people are participating in the RP. However, the more people, the harder it is to keep organized and controlled. Traditionally best and easiest between two people, usually taken on as a way of bonding between two writers. One person starts, the other replies, the first replies to the reply, etc. Often taken on in the writing community between two people who are close friends, or else is used as a way for writers to get used to another person's style. When the two people participating in the RP know one-another very well, it's often possible to distinguish what their reply to a certain situation will be, and can therefore be anticipated and detailed before it even happens. Manners in an RP are actually fairly complicated. Here are the top five main rules that pretty much everyone obeys when it comes down to it... The first and most basic rule is that another person's characters are practically sacred. You are issued your own characters, and you are allowed to get indignant if someone else tries to mess with them. Be sure to ALWAYS check with your partner before fricking around with one of their minor characters, and NEVER try to somehow control another person's main character unless under very extenuating circumstances. Many people have found themselves banned from an RP for a single instance of it. Second rule is, when someone asks you if you want to continue the RP, pay close attention to your mood. If it's a serious story and you're in a playful mood, say you can't do it. Don't even try doing it in the wrong situations, because there are situations where someone will get furious with their RP partner for messing around. This also includes the fact that you should try and keep in mind the laws of physics in whatever world you're writing about. No magical, spontaneous resurrections of characters in worlds that don't have magic unless it can be explained with science. This rule really should never be ignored. Third rule. Don't do too long or short of a reply. You may feel the pressing need to add more and more detail, but it makes the other person wait, and their character doesn't get to interact at all during that time. Also, if it's too short- come on! The other person has to reply! Give them something to reply to! This also includes the fact that every bit should try to have at least a little speech on their part, or in cases of a mute or very quiet character, at least an action the other person can reply to. If nothing else, just have them curl up in a corner and show their thought process. This rule can be ignored under certain circumstances, the biggest one being when it's at the beginning of a story and both people are attempting to establish their characters before they get to the meat of things. Another situation is if the characters are separated temporarily. Fourth rule... please. As grammatically correct as possible. No l33t speak, no ignoring punctuation, and always make sure things are spelled right. It just makes you look like an idiot, and the other person will end up silently frustrated with you. This also includes not naming your character something long, ridiculous, and is unable to be pronounced by any mortal tongue. Some immature RPers ignore this rule entirely, but it makes everyone else roll their eyes. Fifth rule. This one can be ignored, but most people at least offer it. It has to do with noobs to RPing. If one person has done an RP before, and the other hasn't, then the more advanced one often suggests that maybe they should take on most of the characters, leaving the noob with one or two to play around with on their first try. This can be ignored under many circumstances- such as if both are new, or one is new and the other has only done a few RPs. It's mostly advanced RPers who offer it. One last thing to note is that people often have a symbol to show the breaking of the fourth wall, such as *. Try to make it as smooth a transition as possible... don't refer to it as 'my character' or 'your character'. If you want to suggest something to the other person, use *. Such as like this: You want to offer that maybe their character should get captured. You reply, and then at the beginning or end of your reply, you put in *Hey, what if insert name here gets kidnapped?*. If they don't go for it, don't push it. In that way, you can trust that the other person won't push their unliked ideas too hard either. A little tip. Your main character is often referred to as your Chari. It's just a piece of slang that's developed.|||Person B is an example of what NOT to do in an RP : Person A: James walked through the door, looking around nervously. He had to find Sharlene and get out of there before anything else popped out at him. If he ran into another one of those ghouls (he gulped nervously at the mere thought of it), he didn't know if he'd be able to make it out in one piece...Person B: LOL ha ha a ghoul comes out and stabs James in the stomack.Person A: No, it doesn't. As the ghoul comes toward him, James backs off until his back was pressed against the wall. When it lunged at him, he jumped aside, heart beating wildly as he reached out. His hand caught on something, and he raised it high without thinking, bringing it down on the ghoul's head. It fell to the ground, twitched once, and lay still.Person B: Then the ghoul gets up and says "HA HA HA! I don't need a head, bitch! FEAR ME!" and he transforms into my chari Damien Von Glukthenhiemerwhatsisname the 3rd and stabs your chari and James dies of blood loss while Sharlene gets butt-raped by zombies.Person A: *...*Person B: What? Why didn't you reply?Person A: *... I'm going to go have dinner and I'm never coming back.*|||431,230

This is most common on forums, especially with gaming forums where people act out characters from the game or RP in the game's universe. There's simple and narrative RP. Simple has rpers where events and actions are described basically and quickly. This mode allows for developed storylines, conversation, and cooperation. Though simple is usually looked down upon as degenerat and only belonging to n00bs. Narrative has players acting out actions and events very descriptively and often seem like pages from well written novels. Narratives are easy to screw up, allow for no or very little cooperation, and don't have much conversation. But narrative does allow for great fight RPs.V.To role play as in an RP.|||N:Lets do an RP.

yippie|||Term created by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin in the mid-1960s to refer to "members" of the Youth International Party (YIP!).  The YIP! was dedicated to merging New Left activism and the hippie counterculture to create a revolution that would be both personal and political--as well as fun.  Yippies tended to gather in large cities, particularly in Manhattan's Lower East Side, where Rubin and Hoffman both lived during the 1960s.  Yippies rejected all -isms, including socialism and anarchism, in favor of the motto of "Do your own thing"--i.e., don't conform to a specific system of belief but rather be an individual.  At the same time, collective action was at the root of Yippie activism, and Yippies participated in "be-ins" (normally associated with hippies) and other collective gatherings.  And although the YIP! did not promote any one -ism (and, despite Hoffman and Rubin's involvement, was a self-proclaimed "leaderless" movement), the "party" was extremely leftist, advocating social justice for all and arguing that all property--including housing, clothing, and food--should be FREE.  The Yippies' most famous actions include the attack on the New York Stock Exchange (when Yippies threw money to the floor and watched as those below fought for it) and their involvement at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, at which they nominated a pig for president.  Much of the Yippies' activism consisted of guerrilla street theater and symbolic acts (such as that at the NYSE) to make a point; Yippies understood the power of the media and sought press to disseminate their revolutionary messages with a pointed disinterest in the accuracy of the stories told about them.  Since the term is rooted in a particular historical moment, calling anyone a "Yippie" today would probably be inaccurate.|||Abbie Hoffman's Revolution for the Hell of It! is an excellent source for more information on the Yippies.|||251,52

fix|||The proper term for a single gear fixed wheel bicycle. These bikes were traditionally home made by the users; they would take a traditional 10 speed frame toss out the hanging derailleur and remove the 5 speed fly wheel and replace it with a single speed "fixed" hub. These bikes were most popular among NYC bike messengers in the 70's, 80s, and early 90's because of their low maintenance and lighter weight; many users would have only a front brake or forgo brakes totally because you can control the bikes momentum solely suing your feet. These bikes were not for the lazy or lighthearted because they require a much more skilful and alert riding style as well as perpetual motion because the is no "free" spin mode.The Fix could be brought out right in those days at some bike stores by asking for a racing bike. Racing bikes were usually made by Bianchi or Lotus and sported rear facing dropouts for the back wheel; these store bought Fix bikes were uncommon for the average fix rider and primarily purchased by bike messengers.The majority of serous road bike riders, then and now, use geared bikes.Today people are calling bikes like this "Fixies"; there was no such term ( fixie ) being used on the streets in 1970's thru early 90's.Fixie should be used to describe store bought bicycles many of which do not even have fixed flywheels.|||Yo, check out how Joe is riding his Fix.Joe has a Fix with no brakes.|||6,5

l33t|||As the Internet was coming into its own, during the early 1980s, hackers that didn't want their websites, newsgroups, etc, to be picked up in a simple keyword search began using numbers to replace certain letters (mostly vowels) such as A = 4 or E = 3. At this point, l33t speak was only known to a select few and only used when necessary. However, in 1994, id Software began to add Internet connectivity to Doom and Doom II, leading to a revolution in PC gaming and also to the rise of l33t speak. As with any type of competition, 'smack' talk became prevalent in online gaming. Phrases such as 'I am elite' became common place, and somewhere down the line l33t speak crept in, reforming the phrase into '1 4m 3l1t3' in order to demonstrate that the speaker was a hacker and someone to be feared. It was further exaggerated by purposeful bad spelling and eventually wound up as something like this, '1 4m 3l33t!' and simplified to, '1 4m 133t'. Hence the name 'l33t speak'. l33t speak was still relatively unknown to the Internet masses at this point. It had almost disappeared from gaming entirely. However, a very popular web comic called Megatokyo brought l33t speak into mainstream with its infamous speak l33t? comic. These days l33t speak is very well known to the hardcore Internet community (especially gamers). As you've already seen, basic l33t is just replacing vowels with numbers: A = 4E = 3I = 1O = 0However l33t is a very flexible 'language' and you can go from this very basic l33t, to ultra 1337 by being creative; a few examples: O = ()U = |_|T = 7D = |)W = \/\/S = $There is no agreed-upon way to write l33t, so it's up to you whether or not to go with light l33t, medium 1337, hard |_337 or even ultra |_33¯|¯. In this entry, 'l33t' is used except when referring to medium, hard or ultra '1337'. The -0r clause can be used in place of -ed or -er, for example '1 0wnz0r!' (most commonly seen in ultra 1337 as '1 0\/\/|\|z0r!') rather than '1 0wn3d'. However it can also be used like this, '1 4m l33t h4x0r!' (in ultra 1337, '1 4|\/| |_337 |-|4x0r!') rather than, '1 4m 4 133t h4ck3r!'. As a general rule, in l33t, rather than use 's' to make something plural, a 'z' is used instead. Also 'f' is normally changed to 'ph'. The short 'u' is often changed to '00', as well. Punctuation is usually left out with greater consistency as the level of l33t increases. Full stops are left out entirely because, when you are chatting online, where you would normally put a full stop you just hit 'enter' to send the message and keep typing. Exclamation marks are used quite a bit (and usually quite a number at once), mostly because l33t is most commonly used in expressions of pleasure. Commas are generally left out in hard and ultra 1337, and are uncommon in medium 1337. Recently after the dawn of MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft as a popular form of online gaming, l33t speak has become an epidemic to the point of burnout.  Most l33t speak is generally considered a sign of immaturity or is done derisively and tounge in cheek.|||immature:some "l33t" loser "OMGZ0rz WTF n00b u d0n7 5|*34k l33t!!1 u r n0t 4 h4><0rz!!!"everyone else "jeez, what a loser." toungue in cheek:friend 1 "oops i forgot to take off my caps lock"friend 2 "OMGZ CAPS U 5|_|x n00b!!1one  =)"friend 1 "haha.  gosh i must be a noob =p"|||3717,379

honeymoon|||The word "honeymoon" first appeared in English in the 1500s. The first citation of the word appeared in a 1552 glossary printed in England, called Abcedarium Anglico Latinum.   "Honeymoon" is derived from the ancient Germanic custom of having newly-weds drink mead (the 'drink of love') for a whole moon (month) in order to encourage fertility, and a male child in particular.  The history of mead has roots in royalty, religion, sex, and violence throughout the ages of time and cultures of the world. Mead is almost certainly the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man and likely discovered before the wheel was invented.  Mead has for centuries been renowned as an aphrodisiac, and mead's real claim to fame is in its origins in wedding celebrations, hence the word "honeymoon."  Mead was traditionally drunk during the month-long celebrations following weddings to insure fertility and the birth of sons. Some customs sent the bride to bed and then filled the bridegroom with mead until he could no longer stand. He was then delivered to the bride's bedside to sire a son that very night. If, per chance, the bride did, in fact, bear a son nine months later, the maker of the mead was complimented on its quality.|||Jason: How was your honeymoon, Jack?Jack: Super! Drank lots of honey and made passionate love to Jill for a full month. She is now pregnant with our first baby boy.|||89,41
honeymoon|||It was the accepted practice in Babylonia 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink.  Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the honey month, which eventually came to be known as the honeymoon.|||Credit - www.alaskanbeer.com|||125,88

Lumberjack|||The lumberjack is an exciting sexual maneuver which should be only attempted by professionals.   In this case, the woman is on all fours and the man enters her from behind (see "doggie style").  Hole choice is completely up to the lumberjack himself.  When he is ready to cum, he yells "TIMmmBERRRrrrr" and takes out the woman's arms with a svelte swooping motion.  The woman then, like a tree, falls to the bed.  During the fall, the woman experiences excitement as well as fear during her zero gravity experience as she realizes impact is imminent.  This leads to the tightening of her vaginal and anal cavities, yielding an astonishing feeling and hence orgasm for the lumberjack. Extra points can be scored on this maneuver by the close and careful placement of the woman in relation to the headboard.  When the woman's arms are taken out, her head slams into the headboard.  Very fun!|||"Why is Nancy wearing a neck brace at work today?" asked coworker Anne.

camp|||I felt obligated to post this definition of 'camp' since I believe it to be the most accurate.

An affectation or appreciation of manners and tastes commonly thought to be artificial, vulgar, or banal. 4. Banality, vulgarity, or artificiality when deliberately affected or when appreciated for its humor: "Camp is popularity plus vulgarity plus innocence"  adj.   Having deliberately artificial, vulgar, banal, or affectedly humorous qualities or style: played up the silliness of their roles for camp effect.  So you can see, camp, as it was originally known as and still, in my opinion, most accurately, has nothing to do with being gay.|||Campy movies: Attack of the 50-foot Woman, Plan 9 From Outer Space, The Tingler, Barbarella|||657,218

spide|||Native to Belfast, but variations are found throughout the UK under different guises. (e.g, Glasgow/Edinburgh - Neds, Liverpool - Scallies) Spides have a general dress code. This consists of a tracksuit, baseball cap and brilliant white trainors. This uniform is often complimented with a few sovereign rings and the biggest necklace they can afford. A spide can often be found in estates or on some occasions in public. It is when they enter into civilisation that a spide is at it's most dangerous, often hunting in packs for people they don't like the look off. These groups include rival spide groupings, students, 'hippies', ethnic minorities and the elderly. It is advisable to avoid spides as they can get quite aggressive when confronted with reason. In their native habitat of the 'estate', spides like nothing better than drinking 'carry-outs' and fertilising millies. Often cheat the benefits system|||The dole office was full of spides many of whom had little tashes. Janty was there too.|||299,39

Attire:-baseball cap worn at 45 degree angle-white jumper with hood,-either white/blue tracksuit bottoms or cheap jeans with bottoms turned up-florescent trainers or 'cat boots'-thickest, goldest and cheapest rings, ear rings and necklaces. Education:-none Transport:-Anything they can steal-a vauxhall nova/corsa, 'souped up da fuck' occupation:-steal-drugs-paramilitary work-'stroke' from the government|||oh shite we're about to get the shit kicked out of us by those spides|||61,9
spide|||Groups of males (if you could even call them that - fucking pussy bastards) that hang in packs ( very similar to animals) that have the same dresscode and general appearance. This consists of the latest sportswear (track bottoms, football tops and of course their glorious 'nike air max'). They wear the biggest coin rings they can find (Im surprised they havent painted hubcabs gold yet and wear them on their hands). They have very badly shaven heads and barcodes on their upper lip.Usually a smick/spide is called the likes of "Janty", "Aidso", "Anto", "Fra", "Cricky", "Dermy" or you can take their surname and fuck it around too, just to make them be "sweet as".In their native Belfastian dialogue, the word 'Like' will follow nearly every second word or at the end of a sentence. Hobbies and interests include "Fockin' der bitches" (millies), "Spinnin' tha wheeels" (of their bmx cos they cant score a corsa off their ma). "Havin' a swall" is another past time where they pluck up the courage to venture into off liscences to buy "Shum doubelya kay dee bloo like" but if they get "knacked back like" (for looking like complete twats) they ask other members of the public to cooperate with them in their hour of need. If you dont you'll "get yer baallix knacked in like"Spides are generally slow witted, are morons and leech off the government and their "ma's" until they are in their late twenties.Arch Enemies to the local spide communties would be the "huppies" because they are different. "Huppies listen to rock music and wear band tops (which can be quite annoying seeing most of them havent a clue about the band and have only heard one song and by the way KORN ARE SHITE, METALLICA RULE), spides listen to trance music or "beatz" as they call it and make the pilgrimmage to "Godskitchin like" twice a year to  pop a couple of E's and listen to their fav musicians, (like dj-ing really involves talent...yeah right)Spides will steal anything and everything, including their mothers own tv just to get money "fer swall" or "drugz" because they are the scum of the earth and another thing ALL HOODS SHOULD BE SHOT - FUCKING MAGGOT CUNT BASTARDS|||Kevin: I dont like the look of that lotMark: Aye, those spidey bastards would steal the shoes from your feet if you were sitting downKevin: Scumbag government leeching cunts|||72,26

spide|||Known in Norn Irn as "steeks" or "spides" these fearsome individuals terrorise the community. Generally you have two types, a "taiggy rebel bawsturt" and an "arenge cont" depending on what estate they live in. Spides can develop as early as 6 and some breeds are even seen until the late twenties. After this most are either in prison or have died from an accident involving a stolen Astra GTE. It is when spides leave thier council estate and enter into civilisation that the public is most at risk. Particularly at risk are those known as "huppys" or "gafeeks" and "skateboarder freaks" are also high on the target list. If these sub cultures are no careful they could get anything from spat upon to gettin thier "balleex nacked in" if they are particular slabbers. Usually Belfasts other sub cultures are as much to blame but this is another matter. At the age of 15 most spides will have been forced to join thier local under 18's paramilitary organisation. This may be the UYM, YCV, PIRA or in the worst case scenario they will be forced to swear into the Divis Hoods Liberation Army. Some of them get a driving test, and the rest of them buy a Nova SR anyway. These are kitted out with a 5" big bore exhaust and 6x9s playing the likes of DJ Tizer or Clubland 6. For the more style concious spide they may ruin their ma's Corsa or Fiesta 1.1 with the XR2i body kit so no-one will know the difference. For the ones that do it the legal way, these cars are always wrapped round a lamp post before the R plates end. At weekends, spides will enjoy daring each other to get served in the local "offees" for a 3 litre bottle of Olde English or, for the particularly hardcore drinkers of the troops, Buckfast Tonic Wine. Once the spide can no longer get away with a bumfluff 'tache and encounters puberty he will develop stubble. At this point they can then venture up in thier Nova SR/Train to Traks and maybe pop half a "cheeser". Once drunk/tripping, a young milly(female counterpart) will be invited back to the car/his mates flat to get "skelped" which will more often than not encounter her getting up the duff. And thus continuing the cycle.|||Hippy: I love my Korn t-shirt from Fresh Garbage, they are the best band, especially that song I've heard.

Frenchie|||Some people may think the french are poontangs, but those people are general booze-babies and or crackbabies. In reality the french are sexy suave and chill. They do bathe regualarly and despite common belief french women do shave their armpits. In fact in my experience, french chicas are way more banging than fat Mcdonalds loving American girls. french inteligence has often been misidentified as cowardice. Redknecks and hardcore Americans alike, in general do not like the french. This is because they are jelous of the French culture, high literacy rate, sexiness, cool sunglass, superior sense style,sense of national identity, and above all superior nation. The french know how to drink and can hold their liquor; at a party an American often winds up on the floor in a pool of vomit, or humping a passed out fat chika wereing a tiedye t-shirt. A frenchie on the other hand will wind up semi-drunk with "beaucoups belles nouvelles petites amies."

They are heavy weed smokers (n°1 in Europe) and road killers (also n°1 on alcohol-related crashes in Europe) Also, despite common belief, they don't hate the US (lots of em are yankee wanabees), they gave up wearing "kepi" since 1930 or so, and eating frogs or snails isn't "cool" to them.From what i've seen they ain't especially lightweight and they won't take shit from anywone without responding. At last, they are rather warm toward foreigners and they won't mind treating you to a bottle of good wine or a big friendly buzz if you come over.

In this endeavor, he seeks the company of a woman, and she of him...because regardless of intentions, women and men enjoy the company of those who feel "right" to each other. Because this type of woman is generally spoiled by the general delightfulness of gay men, she may scorn straight men for their lack of personality and overall dullness.|||She had a boring but biologically necessary momentary sexual encounter with a straight man named "Todd," but she soon grew bored of his attention and longed to be encircled in the warm and safe womb of the gay bar.

In her mind, she calculated and realized she still had time to make it to the bar and hook up with some boys who would eventually stay until dawn and entertain her bottomless need to be intellectually and emotionally stimulated.

leet|||A derivitave of the  80's software piracy scene. Originally "elite" was used to show status on a BBS. Commonly the people who cracked the software, or had sysop access on a board would be referred to as Elite. Later it became common to just use "leet." With the internet explosion it was later used to describe hackers as well as crackers. Due to it being great to be known as leet, newbies started adopting the term and using to describe themselves, often with numerical variations. Anyone who considers themselves "leet" should be able to tell you who/what Razor1911 is, anyone failing to answer this question should be laughed at.|||"Wow, those guys that run this new board are leet, they had win 3.1 a week before it came out!"|||2469,881
leet|||I'm tired of the stupid shits thinking that they know anything. I'm surprised to see that there hasn't been one correct origin of leet in four fucking pages. Yes, leet means elite. Shut the fuck up about it already. Your insulting or not insulting definition isn't worth putting in just becuase you (just like everybody else) know that stupid little fact. It also isn't funny. Yes, leet is a language, now used by gamers, some deserving of using such a language and some not. As for origins, it started with hackers who DIDN'T create a language when the hacked into Microsoft or whatever shit was put before. In fact, it was used in a sort of sub-text that is included in coding so that hackers who send lines of code to each other would know what it did while others would not. Generally speaking there are two forms of leet; soft and hard core. Softcore can range from simply staggering the case of letters to substituting as many letters as possible for numbers. Hardcore leet involves substituting every character for one or more symbol, creating a complex, purposefully nearly unreadable language that attempts to make symbols look like letters. Despite apparent popular belief, it is not stupid or idiodic, at least when used in moderation and in context. Would you seriously take your opinion from somebody as illiterate as those who posted the shit they did? Please.  n: a language originally created by computer hackers to communicate through their coding while others could not do such a thing. It misspells words that have been commonly misspelled in English, such as "Teh". It also spells most words phonetically, making it as easy to type in leet as possible. When a word ends in "X" or "cks", it is suitable to put an "orz" at the end. DO NOT put this on the end of every word. leet is also a very flexable language, so you can make your own words and modify the English language (teh smecks is a common substitute for sexy) in any way you see fit as long as it's close. adj: superior; elite. If I missed anything, fuck it, I'm tired.|||n: 1 |2 1337 (Direct translation: I r leet. English: I am elite.) adj: That dude's so leet!|||2107,1712

leet|||A way for virgin losers with small penises who live in their parents' basements to feel cool or special by typing so as to replace letters with numbers or phonetic equivalents that are recognizable to others of their nerdly kind.

love|||The most spectacular,indescribable,  deep euphoric feeling for someone.  Love is an incredibly powerful word. When you're in love, you always want to be together, and when you're not, you're thinking about being together because you need that person and without them your life is incomplete. This love is unconditional affection with no limits or conditions: completely loving someone. It's when you trust the other with your life and when you would do anything for each other. When you love someone you want nothing more than for them to be truly happy no matter what it takes because that's how much you care about them and because their needs come before your own. You hide nothing of yourself and  can tell the other anything because you know they accept you just the way you are and vice versa. It's when they're the last thing you think about before you go to sleep and when they're the first thing you think of when you wake up, the feeling that warms your heart and leaves you overcome by a feeling of serenity. Love involves wanting to show your affection and/or devotion to each other. It's the smile on your face you get when you're thinking about them and miss them. Love can make you do anything and sacrifice for what will be better in the  end. Love is intense,and passionate. Everything seems brighter, happier and more wonderful when you're in love. If you find it, don't let it go.|||One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life:  That word is love. -Sophocles|||50555,12287

In a word, there are three things that last forever: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of them all is love.|||1 Corinthians 13|||17479,7549

bogan|||A fascinating beast. The majority of the species are hideously repugnant and unintelligent, and yet they manage to breed in ever-increasing numbers and populate an area known as the outer west. It is quite common to find five or six offspring in each family group, often with a different father for each new baby. Their habitat consists of a weatherboard or brick-veneer dwelling and is characterised by an early-model Holden or Ford in the driveway surrounded by a group of males discussing why the carby is stuffed and the results of last night's footy (a primitive gladiator-like spectator sport enjoyed by most bogans).The female of the species, while smaller in stature, is far more loud and aggressive than the male. While the males tend to be very friendly and congregate with other males, the females spend most of their time in supermarkets and shopping malls, using a shrill high-pitched call to discipline their children and contact other females. Males and females rarely interact socially except during breeding season, which is otherwise known as Friday night. During this time, females are allowed to enter the male-dominated area known as "the pub" and display their impressive coloured plumage to a prospective mate.Herein lies an intersting phenomenon. Males will often fight over a particularly attractive female and she will mate with only one male, while some less attractive females have been known to have several partners simultaneously. Ahhhh. The wonders of nature.|||Chris Franklin, Eric Bana as "Poita" on Fast Forward, most of Campbelltown.|||5718,780

BBW|||bbw stands for "big beautiful women." these are woman who are overweight and still feel deserving of love because they realize that they don't have to live up to certain "standards" that society has set in order to be pretty. this obviously takes self-esteem and courage, and it's a landmark to get past. an overweight woman who still feels beautiful is very admirable.some of the stereotypes that have been written before mine are ridiculous. it seems like half the people on this website think anyone who is overweight sits around all day, never gets off their ass, and only moves when they want to go from the couch to the fridge. this is so far from the truth, and i feel the need to set the record straight. most overweight woman... AND men... are normal people walking around living their lives just like anyone else. i'm sure many would be surprised to see the eating habits of an overweight person. it isn't necessarily a person who sits around eating McDonalds all day, so you best get that out of your head.anyone who is still reading is probably smirking in their seat, muttering "yeah okay fattie." and it is true, i'm overweight, though i am not disgusting. i also have a full-time job, am a part time student, am involved in many activities. i also eat three meals a day just like everyone else. i feel beautiful, but not because i'm overweight and that means i am beautiful, but because i have forced myself to look beyond magazines and the like for answers on what society expects out of me, and i realize that unconventional and non-traditional can also have beauty in it. i can appreciate my body so much more than a thin person, because i've had to work at it, i have never taken it for granted. that is what a bbw is, and this is what she does.also, this stereotype that fat automatically equals lazy is just plain ignorant, people, and it proves that those who say things like that really don't know a whole lot about overweight people. obviously, there is a difference between someone who is HUGE and someone who is just overweight; most who call themselves "bbw" fall into the second category.saying that bbw are a joke because fat is ugly is pointless. the fact that you or everyone on the face of the earth finds them disgusting is not going to make a difference. most who have weight problems have struggled with it all their life and are used to being treated differently, are used harsh attitudes and stereotypes and criticisms. the fact that they are able to rise above that and still feel beautiful is something to be admired. it always makes me happy to see a chubby girl who has self-confidence, because i know how hard it is, and know it is a struggle, and anyone that can rise above their shortcomings is obviously an amazing person.|||What's with all these skinny bitches?

Certain circles will tell you that being L337 requires a person to be able to assemble a computer system while naked. Others believe L337 is something of a scene. A higher echelon of nerd hirearchy. Even further, l337 has also been documented as something of an unwritten religious movement and cult following incorporating computers and various types of media. The favored medium being online video games.

Whip|||A whip is a maneuver performed on a motocross cycle, usually during supercross or motocross racing, in which the rider brings the rear of the motorcycle abruptly around to either side. This is performed while the machine is airborne off a jump. In very extreme whips, the rear of the motorcycle will end up perpendicular to the direction of travel, in addition to the motorcycle being laid flat. The purpose of the whip is primarily threefold: To show off, to alter the trajectory of the bike in flight, and to scrub speed over jumps. Some riders would say that whipping helps them maintain rhythm on the track.|||Did you see that crazy whip that Bubba just threw down!? Sick!|||374,281

Christian Side Hug|||A form of greeting promoted by some Christian groups in which two parties hug by wrapping one arm around the shoulder of the other person, as if posing for a photo, rather than the traditional "front hug," or wrapping both arms around the shoulders or waist from the front. The motivation behind the side hug is that frontal hugs allow the two parties' crotches to touch, apparently emulating sexual activity.While the Christian side hug has been promoted for a few decades, it came to the attention of the Internet with a much-ridiculed Youtube video posted in November 2009, in which a Christian rap group attending the 2009 Encounter Generation Conference, a Christian youth conference, performed a rap song explaining the merits of the side hug. The video's unintentionally humorous message, lyrics, and the behavior of the performers (including mock gunfire and police sirens contradicting the Christian message of the song) made it an Internet sensation, much to the embarrassment of Christians.Debate ensued over how serious the song was intended to be. The writer and lead singer explained that the song was meant to parody overly protective Christian ideas. However, both the lyrics and the EG Conference's website clearly state that anyone caught "front hugging" will be removed from the event, calling this claim into question. Regardless, the video has already become extremely popular on Youtube and has spawned several spoofs.|||Guy: Hey babe, what's up?

Christian Side Hug|||Yes, God wants us to be compassionate and kind and tender with each other. Not only that, but he wants us to love our enemies and serve our neighbors. As long as there is no body on body action. I’m talking of course about a “full frontal hug,” one of those sinful abominations where you just wrap your arms around a friend and embrace them. That’s why Christians the world over have pioneered the “side hug.” In the side hug there’s no risk of two crotches touching. Instead of face to face, you go side to side, putting your arm around the person and your hip against their’s. Still having a hard time mastering it? Pretend you’re taking a photo and you’re both looking at the camera together. The side hug, or A frame as it is also called, is safe for the whole family, friendly and above all holy.

spiv|||A 'Spiv' is the name generally given to a shady character who may try to sell counterfeit objects to you at a discounted price.In the Balgowlah Boys' Campus, however, Spiv is more commonly known as the biggest and most hardout frother on the face of the earth, Ancient History/English teacher Mr. Ian James.Legend as to how he got his name is that apparently one day back in yesteryear, his Year 12 class were bludging and not doing the amount of work Mr. James had come to expect of them, so he simply called them 'a bunch of Spivs'. Apparently this joke had backfired, with his entire Year 12 class turning on their teacher and calling him 'Spiv'.Ever since then, this name has survived the passage of time and has stuck to the teacher like a Redskin to a 7-year-old retarded boy's palate (roof of mouth for those of you playing at home).Spiv is one of the most renowned dwellers of Bally Boys, and he himself has come to epitomize the true nature of Bally Pride. He is also famous for spawning the term "Dodgy!" after his 2008 Year 12 Ancient History class asked him if they could watch the film 300, to which he replied "More like 300 Dodgies!", a claim that the film didn't stick to the facts of history.He is renowned for calling boys "Dodgy!" if they perform something slightly left-field, if they don't hand in assessments, or if Spiv just bloody well feels like calling someone "Dodgy!".Rumour has it (started by Dr. Joshua Risbey, MD, PhD, Dr. Paul 'Sparta' Barta, Phd, PhDSCPF, and Awww Shot M) that Spiv also indulges in the banging of a certain Smoh Ah creature that is often found to be lurking G Block of Bally Boys Campus.|||Boy: AWWW SHOT SPIV!Spiv: Dodgy, mate, just dodgy.Boy: Oi Spiv can we crank on 300 and froth hard?Spiv: Ey, ey, I'll have none of that boys, more like 300 Dodgies, eh eh!Boy: Oi Spiv you've been out back banging Smoh Ah again, haven't you?Spiv: (bewildered) Who's Smoh Ah?*Smoh Ah walks in the door*Dr. Joshua Risbey MD, PhD: AWWWWWWW SMOH AH!Spiv: Eh boys, just keep doing your work and stop being dodgy, I'm off to putt some golf-balls!|||51,82

sugar daddy|||Like a genie - he may be a little old, but if a girl rubs his lamp, he'll grant her wishes.|||She uses her sugar daddy for his money, but he sure gets some service in return!|||4207,1131
sugar daddy|||A man who provides money or other favors in exchange for sexual relations.|||"All that bitch wants is a sugar daddy."|||2109,1006
sugar daddy|||Older males are in their money making prime And young women are in their money needing prime and beauty prime. These three primes often converge creating the secret underground "older man being financially generous to beautiful younger woman" situation.  The idea that all sugar daddies are rich is a stereotype and cliche. That's like saying "all johns are rich". Fact is, sometimes all a poor or needy female wants is for you to help her provide food and basic things for her children she can't afford or maybe help her afford cable television or an education or... just a place to live while she gets on her feet. It's not how rich YOU are that matters, its how POOR she is. Poor females are very open to sugardaddies of all income brackets (well, except maybe poor). Sugar daddying young women is generally seen as "immoral behavior" but most believe that the origins of that taboo has more to do with society's hatred for "older men/young women" couples than money itself (a hatred likely invented by older women and indoctrinated into us via the mothering process). Because of the somewhat taboo nature of sugar daddying  or having a sugar daddy, most of these types of relationships are top secret and hush hush. You won't usually know that that  22 year old woman has a secret 51 year old  sugar daddy who earns $60,000-$1,000,000 annually and provides for her as if she were his wife.  A young woman will usually not admit she has a sugar daddy since she knows she will be called a "whore/prostitute" and men will not admit he is a young woman's sugardaddy because he knows he will be called a "dirty old man" for dating a young woman (even if he was once a boy toy. No male is immune to that smearing). The fact is, a young woman with an older man is the ONLY human in society who will NOT call him a "dirty old man" for admiring her beauty (older women most definately will call him that, some men might, young males most definately will, and maybe some young women will. but she won't). This makes her the only person even REMOTELY deserving to share in men's successes to begin with. Young women who don't call older men "perverts, dirty old men, letches" DESERVE the generosity of older men. Not the label tossers of society.   My sister calls sugar daddy's "buytoys" for young women.|||"What older men lack in beauty they gain in generosity. I would love to move in with a sugar daddy buytoy right now. I'm tired of paying rent."-Leesa "Every boytoy's BIGGEST dream is to grow into a young adult woman's  sugar daddy's buytoy. Hopefully no older women will call him a predator or pervert.

LSD|||D-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Synthetic chemical which, when taken orally or, less commonly, in the lining of an eyelid or nostril, is the most potent hallucinogen known to the common public. One of the cheapest drugs available, it is neither addictive nor physically dangerous. Taken by an intelligent, open-minded person, it can create fantastic revelations and experiences. It is not a good party drug, and, in a hostile environment such as a party, it can lead to what is known as a 'bad trip', where the person under the influence of the substance in question has an experience which is totally frightening. Fear, depression and anger are accentuated to fill the entire body to a point where entire thought patterns are controlled by these emotions. The same accentuation goes for happiness and relaxation, often leading to a state of artificial nirvana, the only difference being that the person is absolutely suggestible and can lose the ability to reason.|||It's funny how there are actually quite a few serious definitions of LSD on UrbanDictionary. The ignorant and uneducated fear LSD, but the intelligent, after reading about its effects, are the ones who try it, taking special care about risks and so on.  It is only when one becomes cocky and stupid that LSD causes bad effects.|||5307,984
LSD|||LSD (D-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) is a synthetic hallucigenic drug, although it doesn't produce hallucinations but more severe distortions of the senses and thinking. It was synthized By Albert Hoffman from Ergotamine which is found in the deadly poisonous Ergot Fungus that used to grow on crops. it gives hallucinations and gangreen. LSD's treshhold dose is 25 micrograms. Common taken doses are about 100 micrograms. It is usually taken in the form of paper blotters; small pieces of absorbant paper with some liquid LSD sprayed on them. The effects are mood-changes, a lot of them, visual tracers,  colors, synthesia, and other 'distortions' of the senses. With higher doses everything seems to melt, move and change around you. Your thoughts become bizarre and often confused.Very low doses give the feeling of being stoned.The effects last 8 to 12 hours, depending on the dose and the indifidual.  There have been accidents on LSD, even suicides, but compared to other drugs not many at all. It was used mostly in the 60th's, untill it got made illigal and people started speading nonsense about it. It can cause schitzophrenia in sensitive people; and post-traumatic stress after a bad trip (which means nothing more then that you fought of the effect too mch) and in some cazes flashbacks (random comming back of the effect). Lsd is not very dangerous, its not poisionous and its LD50 is far above the user dose. The psychological effects are more dangerous in that. You need almost grams to get you killed and take micrograms as effect. Blotters of paper can not contain enough of other drugs to give you dangerous ammounts of that. Psysically it causes a raised bloodpressure, faster heartbeat, temperature increase, sweatyness, thighning of the neckmuscles and sometimes nausea and dizzyness. Most people hardly notice this trough the mind-effects. Should still be used with causion.|||They tripped of LSD yesterday and said they had great visuals.|||1274,686

horny|||i assume that if you're looking up horny you're probably horny in some way, hence the first example. what happens to me after reading anything. the state i am in after reading the above definitions. desiring sex or a wanting to masturbate. see ganting or randy|||Warning to all males!The following example may make you horny, so if you're in a public place where someone might see your bone, refrain from reading by clicking the red x at the top right corner of your window. Thank you, and enjoy if you're already horny. The lecture about rocket thrusters and heat transfer makes me really horny, my rocket expanding due to increased o fuel flow, so I remove my rocket from it's secret lair in my pants. My rocket science teacher gives me a glare and walks over to me. But instead of yelling at me like I thought she would, she says seductively, "Let me lubricate your rocket for you," and starts to unbutton her blouse. As soon as she removes all of her clothes, she takes off my jeans and my boxers as I caress and lick her tits. Staring up at me with a look of bestial lust, she started to pump my rocket in and out of her mouth, sweet and moist, faster and faster. The feeling of my rocket in her mouth are insane. But soon she can't contain herself any longer, so she pushes me onto my back on the table, straddling her beautiful body on my hips. I guide my rocket into her spaceport, and she starts to bob her spaceport up and down my rocket on top of the table, moaning and purring with ecstasy. Her back arches, as the rhythm and tactile pleasure increases tenfold again and again and again and again as my rocket thrusts in and out of her spaceport, the oily lubricant of her spaceport facilitating the euphoric sensations in my rocket. Her spaceport moving ever faster up and down my rocket, she sighs and groans gradually become louder and louder every second until she begins to scream breathily in heaving gasps, "OOOUUHH GOOOOOD, YEAAAA, OOOUUHHH! OOOUUHHH YEAAAA! ENTER MY SPACEPORT! DRIVE IT HARDER AND HARDER! HARDER!! OOOUUHHH! OOOUUHHH! OOOUUHH YEAAAA!" The friction between her spaceport rubbing against my rocket becomes unbearably blissful. The pleasure is too much: whitish fuel leaves my rocket in a violent starburst of infinite ecstasy. After that, I am not so horny and my rocket falls back to earth, it's engine and thrusters limpid from exhaustion and stress. I hope this example made you horny, because it certainly made me horny writing it. Reading defs and writing this def on horny made me so horny I made sweet love to the copying machine.|||25923,15575

horny|||When a person feels intense sexual desire.|||They went on a movie date and then he drove them back to her apartment. He walked her to the door and geve her a gentle kiss goodnight. With no words spoken, they both somehow knew what would happen next. She unlocked the door and took his hand, leading him inside. He kicked the door shut behind him and they sat down on the couch. They simultaneously rushed to embrace each other and they began to kiss. She ran all of her fingers through his hair just the way she knew he loved. He knew just how to make her horny. While they kissed, he placed one hand on her hip, slowly stroking up and down her side, just barely allowing his thumb to graze the side of her breast each time. He put his other hand on the back of her neck and gently massaged the small indentations behind her earlobes. This made her start to breathe heavier and moan a little. He noticed this and started to feel her up just a tiny bit faster. "Oh," she thought, "Oh, he is soooo goooood at this." She felt her cunt begin to moisten and continued to kiss him. He let his tounge explore every inch of her mouth, using an amazing rhythm. She couln't contain her feelings any longer. She stopped kissing his lips and leaned her head back. She put her hands on his shoulders.  He didn't break his rhythm and started to kiss her neck. He let both of his hands run up and down her sides as he started to suck on her neck. They knew it would leave a hicky but neither one of them cared.  He took her face in his hands and started kissing her on the lips again. He let one hand touch her cheek and placed the other on her knee. He slowly ran his hand up her thigh until he finally felt himself lifting up her skirt. She wished he would just rip off his pants and fuck her right there, but he went slow just to torture her. He slowly pushed her so she was on her back on the couch and he got on top of her and continued to kiss her. Then he changed the pace and started kissing her really slowly. He wanted to hear her moan in desire for him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he let one of his hands run up under her shirt, slowly and softly touching her wonderful skin. She finally decided to move it along because she was getting extremely horny, so she reached down and pulled off his shirt. She ran her hands up and down his smooth, muscular chest and abs, turning him on a lot. He kept kissing slowly though, knowing that she would soon be begging him for more. He continued to kiss her, and he lifted off her blouse and tossed it to the side. He stadled her and used both hands to massage her breasts in tune with the timing of his kisses.  He did this for a while, enjoying listening to her moan with desire and pleasure. Then he started to kiss her neck, and then slowly mived down to her chest. He stopped to take off her bra, then he gently kissed the very tip of each nipple as she gasped for air. He kissed her stomach lightly as he pulled off her skirt and panties. He undid his jeans and kicked them off. At this point she was so horny she thought she would burst with anticipation. Everything he did to her was so slow, but so perfect. She was soaking wet, and she could see that he had an erection through his boxers. She wanted to tell him to go faster, but just at that moment he started to lick her clit right on the top of it. She threw her head back and moaned with joy. He knew exactly what to do to make her consumed by pleasure. He let his tounge devour her clit and she burst into orgasm and started to writhe underneath him. He moved up and started to make out with her again; he didn't want her to catch her breath. While she was still recovering from her first orgasm, he took off his boxers and she saw his 10-inch-long, rock-hard, super-thick cock. She got the idea to give him a blowjob to return the favor of his oral sex, but before she could even move he had penetrated her vagina.  He didn't even think about wanting a bj, he just wanted to pleasure her. He knew that if he could give her another orgasm, she'd pleasure him all he wanted later. He started to move in and out, back and forth, but very slowly all the while. He was so big, she couldn't even think straight. He picked up one of her legs and put it over his shoulder, as he stood next to the couch and penetrated her.  His huge cock went really deep into her pussy, and it felt amazing. She finally was unable to take how slow he was going, and she begged him for more. "Oh, baby. Oooohhh, go faster! Aaaahhh! Oh, yes! Aaawww right there, baby, OOOHHH!" she yelled as he picked up the speed. "Ooohhhh! Harder! Aaaahhh! Yes, yes, yes! Oooohhhh! Oh baby fuck me more! OOOHH! AAAHHHH! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! AAAAHHH!" she continued to scream as he complied with her demands and she felt pleasure build inside her.  He was going faster and harder and deeper than he'd ever thought possible, and she was loving every second of it. She let out a loud, high pitched scream as she hit her second orgasm. Her vagina pulsed around his huge cock but he pulled out so he wouldn't come just yet. He wanted to stay hard so he could pound her some more. He put her leg down and got on top of her again. He re-entered her and started to move very slow. He went in and out so gently and slowly, she wanted to scream for more, but she held back. She started to learn to appreciate each and every penetration, tensing up with pleasure each time he slowly pushed all the way in. He smiled to himself as he watched her light up with pleasure each time he gently penetrated.  His slow movements found her g-spot. He let his dick gently touch it with each entrance into her. He used his thumb and gently rubbed around her clit once during each soft penetration. He started to suck on her nipple in rhythm with all of his other movements. She thought she was going to explode with pleasure at any second. At that moment he simultaneously hit her g-spot and her clit with his dick and his thumb and she boomed into her third orgasm with the most force yet. She writhed underneath him during her 2-minute orgasm, and her pussy pulsed around his monster cock until his pleasure burst and he came into her. He exited her, and kissed her once on the lips. They fell asleep on that couch and stayed there until morning.|||20308,11840

YESSSS!" by this time, many other football players had turned up, even the coach, for pregame practice, and when she noticed, she withdrew davie's cock from her pussy and opened her legs to them, throwing her head back and moaning, 'SATISFY ME, BABY!" they wrestled for the chance and each tore off their pants, and exposed their throbbing hard cocks, and had their way with her one by one, and each was exhausted afterwards, kylie continued masturbating with both hands in the bathroom after all of them were fully dressed, and when the crowd turned up, they were all wondering why the football team was doing so badly, it was like they had run ten miles for practice!|||9358,6729

Go full retard|||when an actor portrays a mentally disabled character as *totally* mentally disabled, with few if no redeeming values.  Oftentimes in Hollywood, actors are known to sink to the lowest common denominator, and try to play mentally disabled characters in what are really shameless attempts to win audience and critic sympathy, in what is usually a desperate bid for an Oscar.  Sometimes, playing a mentally disabled character actually *does* result in winning an Academy Award, so long as you *don't* "go full retard": That is, the mentally disabled character *should* face some obstacles, but also have some redeeming values (an "idiot savant").  For example, Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man" was "mentally disabled" but he was really an autistic mathematical genius.  Tom Hanks in "Forrest Gump" was mentally handicapped, but it still a very functional individual and in his own way, charming in his honest if simple morality to people me meets, and further, he has some real above-average talents, such as being an Olympic-level ping pong player and an excellent long-distance runner.   However, this doesn't work if the actor's performance as the mentally disabled character has *absolutely* no redeeming values and is indeed "full retard" mode:  a character that is utterly handicapped mentally and really has no "hidden surprise talents"; this ends up just being a film following an average mentally disabled person around for the whole run time. Such was infamously the case with Tugg Speedman's flop movie "Simple Jack".  That is not to say that Speedman gave a lazy performance:  on the contrary, he spent untold hours studying mentally disabled people until he could perfectly imitate what such a person would act and sound like.   The problem is...that's not what Oscar-voters want to see.  They don't want to see the struggles of a mentally disabled person in everyday life.  What gets the Oscar votes in such performances are unrealistic "idiot-savants" who while mentally handicapped, might be really good at mathematics, or a good painter, etc. etc.   In and of itself, this means that ironically, Hollywood isn't actually interested in films about what real mentally handicapped people are like; they're interested in movies about characters who have a few mental handicaps, but are also capable of unrealistically extraordinary things.   What Speedman did, actually trying to portray a character as *fully* mentally handicapped without any "hidden talents", is a death sentence for a film. This is why actors in films that actually portray what real-life mentally handicapped people are like, such as Cuba Gooding Jr in "Radio", or Sean Penn in "I Am Sam", have failed to win Oscars for their performances. In short, an actor should never "go full retard" if they expect to make a successful Oscar vehicle.|||"Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man. Looked Retarded. Acted Retarded. NOT retarded. He could count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT retarded. Tom Hanks' Forest Gump. Slow? Yes. Retarded? Maybe. Braces on his legs.  But he charmed the pants off Nixon, and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded!  Peter Sellers, "Being There", infantile? Yes. Retarded? No. You went full retarded man. You never go full retard.  Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed."|||210,49

All while being hilariously unaware that everyone in the room takes a deep sigh and rolls their eyes when this person starts to speak.|||Even though 29 year old Sarina, who had a rocky relationship lasting about a year and change with her f-buddy turned boyfriend of about 5 years younger, and had just mentioned several times within the past month about leaving him, was an attention whore, so she couldn't handle the fact that her younger sister of 7 years (who everyone seemed to adore because she was lovable, cute and quirky as opposed to an icy bitch that steamrolled anyone who got in her way, among other major personality disorders) had just announced an engagement to her live-in boyfriend of over 3 years, so she did the only thing she could do to make herself feel better and grab the limelight for herself-- she announced 2 weeks after her younger sister got engaged that she too was getting engaged and would be getting married about 1 month before her younger sister in pretty much the same exact fashion as her sister's wedding.  This coming out of nowhere and without a ring even, which she chalked up to being something minimal that wasn't needed (she later got one about 1.5 months later when she had the money).  Then, later, after several months of hell for the younger sister who was pressured from all angles to join Sarina in a double wedding day reception (to apparently support her financially because she couldn't afford everything herself) that goes against everything that her younger sister and her fiancé wanted for themselves, the wedding goes down and Sarina of course plays the control freak at every situation, not letting her younger sister have any say in any matters, as she steamrolls her at every disagreement, all while carefully making sure that she-- not her sister, was at the very center of any attention throughout the months leading up, and during the day of the wedding.  Other characteristics include “raging bitch disorder”, excessive crying over petty meaningless crap (and then denying that you ever cry, when everyone knows you do it at least a couple times a week in public), waving and slamming papers in other people’s faces, talking really LOUD, making sure that everyone hears your voice over everyone else in the room, and being very defensive and taking things personal and wrong in almost every situation.  Basically just acting like a moronic emotional powder keg in every situation, and being completely oblivious to the fact that most people that know you are whispering things behind your back.|||420,169

It is in situations like this, where there is pressure to acquiesce a measure of social etiquette with a response but insufficient time/desire to address the situation with the full answer as would normally be offered that we have use for this term.  In definition 1 then the implied sentiment, if transcribed, would be, "I acknowledge that you still exist...that's great...good work...I'd love to take the time to greet you properly but I simply cannot at the moment." (Note: it's possible that, in fact, you would not love to take the time to greet that person properly; in any instance) Regarding definition 2, intonation is an important variable.  Again the same theme of deterring a conversation is at heart, but in the interests of satisfying social etiquette the term may be used with varying intonation to reveal some extra detail as to the person's sentiment/mood.  A short descending tone might, for example, reveal anger (another reason why you should not try to have a conversation with that person), while a stretched monotone might be used to express boredom or discontent.  With experience this term can come to have a variety of specific meanings when accompanied by a mastery of its applicable intonation.|||Mike:  "Hey John!" John:  "Bleh."|||189,108

pro-ana|||A movement, largely internet-based, that portrays anorexia (and sometimes bulimia; other eating disorders, such as compulsive overeating, are not part of the pro-ana movement) as a lifestyle choice rather than a disease or disorder.  Countless websites devoted to the concept have sprung up on the internet, and it has been the object of much (largely negative) media attention.  The larger pro-ana sites tend to feature message boards, chat rooms, or other forums for communication.  There is some distinction between sites:  sites that are defensive of "ana" (this word is often associated with pro-ana individuals) as a positive lifestyle choice, those who advocate eating disorder acceptance rather than active promotion of such disorders (these may not portray themselves as pro-ana), and sites that support anorexia without offering support to individuals attempting to "develop" the disorder.|||She was so fiercly defendant of her eating disorder that she started a pro-ana website to express her view of anorexia as a choice. Though the site offers support to those suffering from eating disorders, it does not consider itself pro-ana.|||342,83
pro-ana|||There are, in fact, two separate pro-ana "movements" - both of which function mostly via the Internet. One movement (let's call it M1) attempts to glamourize and glorify a horrifying disease (this would be the group that gets the most publicity); the other (M2) acts as a support for those who suffer from Anorexia Nervosa but are not yet "ready" to recover.If a person does not want to recover, no force on Earth can make him/her. Even if he/she is hospitalised and forced to gain weight, all he/she is going to do as soon as he/she is released is start over, anyway.M1 websites/communities encourage disordered eating and reinforce unrealistic ideals of physical perfection, offering dangerous tips on how to lose weight faster. These are the groups that promote Anorexia as a "lifestyle choice".The goal of M2 websites/communities is to support and protect genuine sufferers, while also pursuading those seeking to develop an eating disorder to find safer ways to lose weight or simply to learn to love themselves as they are. These sites/groups often show examples of "bad tips" (eg. using a Lifesavers mint tied to a piece of dental floss to self-induce vomiting, which is incredibly dangerous) and usually list ways to actually minimize the damage caused by long-term disordered eating and binge/purge behaviour (eg. swilling/gargling bi-carb in water after purging to neutralize acid in the mouth, taking multivitamin and mineral suppliments, etc.). M2 sites/groups discourage laxative, diuretic and diet pill abuse, often giving graphic warnings of the long-term effects of these, while M1 sites/groups often encourage such dangerous habits. In short, some pro-ana sites/communities are having a positive effect on the growing epidemic of eating disorders, keeping many chronic sufferers from committing suicide or succumbing to complications of their illnesses; however, many, which encourage disordered eating and behavioural patterns, are fuelling this epidemic, destroying young lives and dividing families. PRO-ANA is NOT just ONE movement.|||ACTUAL M1 pro-ana welcome message: "The Goddess Ana offers us perfection and asks only for our complete devotion and dedication in return. Serve her and she will grant you thinness." ACTUAL M2 pro-ana welcome message: "Anorexia Nervosa is a deadly disease. Once you have it - assuming you don't die a long, painful death from malnutrition - you will never, ever be truly well again. You will spend the rest of your life feeling empty, lost, alone and inadequate. If you have come here looking to "get" anorexia, I recommend you do your research on what that actually means before you make up your mind. There is nothing beautiful or glamourous about Anorexia Nervosa."|||199,48
