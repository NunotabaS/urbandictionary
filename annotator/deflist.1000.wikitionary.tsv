Capoeira|||Capoeira is a combination of dance, ritual, and martial arts that developed out of the Portugese trade of African slaves to Brazil during the 16th century. Capoeira was illegal in Brazil until the 1930's. The ritual game begins with two players squatting in a circle, or roda, of spectators. The players rest at the feet of a single-stringed instrument, or berimbau, and one player sings a commencement song. The other player can sing in response or remain silent to allow the first player to sing the announcement that the game has started. The musician at the berimbau then picks up the song as the players move to the center of the circle. The lead berimbauist is the Mestre, or master of the capoeira game. The roda chants, sings, and drums under the direction of the Mestre. The players and the Mestre carry on a dialogue during the game; the music sets the tempo for the tricks that a player can use. A player may also improvise his movements according to the musical commentary the Mestre gives to his performance. The Mestre in turn may play music that reflects the players' attitudes, reactions and strategies.|||The goal of the game, or jogo, is to catch the opponent off-guard using guile, technique and gymnastics. Players can fake each other out using rapid kicks, cartwheels, handstands, leg sweeps, flips, jabs, dodges, and turns. The base movement, and the one most often used by beginners, is a side-to-side motion in a semi-crouched stance called ginga. Unlike most martial arts, strikes are admired most when there is no physical contact. A player gains the most applause when the other player has been skillfully baited into a vulnerable, off-balance position, but has not actually fallen or been hit. Although there is no point system, and no official winners or losers, players can be disqualified for falling into a seated position or, in some forms of capoeira, using their hands to strike. Some speculate that the lack of hand use in capoeira harkens back to an ancient Kongo saying: "hands are to build, feet are to destroy." Modern martial artists have two main choices for capoeira techniques and philosophy. Angolan capoeira is the more traditional form, with slow, dance-like steps while Regional capoeira relies much more on high-energy acrobatics. Capoeira today is truly a global phenomenon with schools teaching Angolan, Regional and dozens of fusion styles in major cities all over the world.|||886,229
Capoeira|||Afro-brazilian martial art of unclear origin.  Many believe that it was an adapted fighting style, hidden behind the guise of dance to fool captors due to the learning of self defense amongst slaves was forbidden (since they did not want the slaves to present a threat to them, or to injure themselves and thus become uneconomical); or merely the adaption of the 'Lions Dance' - a ritual performed in certain parts of africa during the rite of ascention when a boy became a man (to atract females through prowess and physical ability) and still others believe other things.  There is numerous evidence for and against each theory presented.  What we do however know is that Capoeira is a graceful art, half fighting and half dancing, closely linked to the learning and performance of not only the lethal attacks, the mind-defying 'style moves' and the playing of instruments: such as the berimbau (long, wooden, single-stringed instrument with a gourd near the bottom played by striking the string).|||We're holding a Capoeira demonstration at the beach this Sunday.

Pasadena|||Pasadena, also known as "Dena" or the "626" is a city near LA, best known for the rose bowl games(which USC always wins) and the rose parade (which is only cool to the people who dont live in Pasadena). Full of Bloods (PDL), Crips, Latin Kings, Villa Boys, Thugs, tweakers, hobos, rich snobs, and everything else. It has underrated public schools who people love to critisize (Muir,PHS,Marshall,Blair,Rose City) which is mostly for the blacks, hispanics, and lower class white people who love to party, get wasted, and have fun. Muir is usually thought of to be the ghettoest one because it is in the "hood" which is in north-west pasadena near altadena (but thats where the best athletes tend to be). But Pasadena also has a whole bunch of private schools for the rich people who dont want their "precious" little kids to be affiliated with the "lower class" kids(Maranantha,La Salle,...etc) those are the kids who you'll usually see kikin it at the paseo on colorado st.|||Dawg lets go to Pasadena and party it up in the 626!|||125,48

Pasadena|||DENA|||Pasadena, MD: Despite the popular belief that the general population consists of uneducated, toothless ho-bags, everyone who lives or grew up in Pasadena knows that this group makes up only approximately 5% of the population.  75% of the population knows how to fix your car or how to put an addition on your house.   20% of the population hold college degrees and have jobs that are completely useless...but they make lots of money anyway.  This group generally has not learned anything useful in their lives, and therefore cannot fix cars or build anything without it promptly falling apart.  This group gives most of its pay to the other 75% that know how to fix cars and build houses.   2% of the group that holds a college degree also have graduate degrees.  They generally wonder what they're doing in Pasadena when they could be living in neighboring Severna Park or Arnold.  However, they realize that in Severna Park, they could lose their life savings if their dog craps on the neighboring lawyer's lawn.  In Pasadena, the neighbor will thank you for the free fertilizer.   Despite the popular notion that there is nothing to do in Pasadena, there are various restaurants in which one could eat.  Most of the teenagers who live in Pasadena don't realize that their cars can travel distances greater than 10 miles, and could land them in Annapolis or Baltimore in about 15-20 minutes.  They would rather drive a few miles and hang out in the local fast-food eatery's parking lot.  Some local teens lack the funds to finance a vehicle due to spending all of their money on spray paint...which they use to tag signs, fences, etc.  In this way, they can mark their territory on property not owned by them, and pretend that they own something.  This group of teens will never own anything because they are essentially morons.  This is as close as they will ever get to property ownership.   Half of the population owns a boat.  30% of the boats are in working order.  The other 70% are owned by college graduates...who spent all of their money on getting their car and house fixed by the other group that do not have college degrees...and they have no money left to pay to fix their boats.|||89,49

ActionScript|||The scripting language created by Macromedia (now Adobe) for use with Flash, a rich media format that drives most interactive experiences on the Web these days. ActionScript is developed based on the ECMA-262 standard, the same standard JavaScript is based on.  ActionScript was first made available in the Flash IDE version 4 with very basic controls mostly to control the starting and playing of specific frames. Starting in Flash 5, ActionScript has been expanded to be full-fledged scripting language and was finally editable within a text editor. With Flash MX 2004 (simultaneous FP version 7), Macromedia introduced ActionScript 2.0, a much revised version that supports strict variable typing and class-based construct. AS2 revolutionizes Flash development and allows large and complex environments to be built while utilizing most object-oriented programming principles.  Adobe (purchased Macromedia in 2006) is currently busy working on ActionScript 3.0, which greatly expands on AS' matured status. AS3 is currently available for Flex 2.0 development, and is expected to be released for the Flash IDE with version 9.|||ActionScript 1.0function Foo() {  this.sucks = true;}var foo = new Foo();trace(foo.sucks) // outputs true ActionScript 2.0class org.f.Foo{  private var $sucks:Boolean;   public function get sucks():Boolean  {    return $sucks;  }   public function Foo()  {    $sucks = true;  } } import org.f.Foo;var f:Foo = new Foo();trace(foo.sucks) // outputs true|||13,5

pharisee|||Jesus Christ defined pharisees in the following passage; “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.  So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.  They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. “Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteriesa wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them ‘Rabbi.’ “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one Master and you are all brothers.  And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.  Nor are you to be called ‘teacher,’ for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant.  For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. “Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’  You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?  You also say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.’  You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?  Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.  And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.  And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices–mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law–justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence.  Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.  In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.  And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’  So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers! “You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?  Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.  And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.  I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation. (Matthew 23:1-36)|||If you read the passage and then look at the actions of golden boy George W.

stiletto heel|||A type of heel on a woman's shoe that is less than 1 cm wide at the tip. The original stiletto heels in 1953 were about 4 inches high and were made of hardwood sheathed in steel or were solid aluminium with screw in steel tips. Though some of today's stiletto heels have exposed steel or brass heels, since 1958 up to present they have been mostly made from hard plastic with a steel tube inside to strengthen them; the steel tips have a thin metal rod that fits very tightly into this tube.  Today's stiletto heels can be as thin as 0.5 cm and as low as 1.5 inches or as high as 5 inches; any higher generally requires a thick platform sole as in the modern pole dancer shoes where the often transparent moulded plastic platform unit has a 6 inch heel and a 2 inch platform sole. Such shoes are also quite popular for “ballbusting” They were once seen as dainty and fragile, but both the damage that they caused to floors and being named after a thin lethal dagger, means that nowadays most people see them as being dangerous. They have thus taken on sado-masochistic connotations and though most people would never admit it, they fascinate both men and women because of their lethal power. The stiletto heeled leather boot (kinky boot) has always been the symbol of the dominatrix and this item has passed into the mainstream to become a standard fashion item for the modern woman.  High heeled shoes have always been regarded as sexy, not just for their body altering and leg lengthening effect, but in themselves; the heel is a phallic symbol and the arch under the heel is a vaginal symbol. But the stiletto has this extra lethal dimension in that they are capable of piercing things such as testicles for instance. Team them with pointed toes, particularly the new long pointed toes (a phallic symbol in itself!), and you have an incredible instrument of either pleasure or castration! Stiletto heels whether boots, sandals, slippers or pumps are sometimes used in sexual foreplay. The thinnest heels are thin enough to insert into the end of the male penis and push down a good 3 inches or so and the heels can also be used along with pointed toes to playfully kick and tease the testicles. During the sex act the heels can be used as spurs to urge the male on or slow him down and for the male, the combination pain and pleasure of heels in the thighs and calves together with nails in the back and the sexual orgasm can give a tremendous endorphin rush! Contrary to popular belief amongst many men and women who don't wear them, with practice they are not difficult to walk in and today's career women can be seen  running for trains, hopping on and off subways and buses and hurrying up and down stairs. Some will tell you that they feel confident and even invincible in business meetings and presentations; their distractive 'erection getting' qualities means that while the men are busy trying to wrestle with thoughts of sex, they can take advantage of them and win the argument or the deal. Much to the disgust of many 40 and 50 something feminists, it is the stiletto clad post-feminist modern 'have it all' career woman of today who is reaping the hard earned benefits of the feminist era and she is using her sexuality to get ahead even further, - but on her own terms not the men's. It's not for nothing that those successful and ruthless women on Wall Street and in the City district of London were and are called "Spike-Heeled Power Bitches"! The pointed toe stiletto-heeled pump (or court shoe) once the symbol of female oppression, has become the long pointed toed stiletto heeled ankle boot that is now the symbol of the get ahead career woman!|||His manhood grew stiff in anticipation as the stacatto click of approaching stiletto heels grew nearer.....|||316,139

disturbed|||Arguablly one of the greatest bands of the nu metal genre and possibly the greatest metal band ever. With Draimans razor-sharp vocals and the bands savage guitar sounds and meaningfull lyrics that range anywhere from the torment of the soul to ripping some one a new asshole, or the ignorance of people and their constant tendency to limit their selves beyond anything that will cause them any  discomfort, challenge their views, or force them to actually think at all; to just the surge surge of adrenaline you get when you rock out and mosh to to something really violent, heavy and truly kick ass. That which is what the metal genre has been built on. Any one who thinks that Disturbed's lyrics are old, tiresome, and trivial forget that TRUE metal is not based on lyrics alone, that TRUE metal is a mix of hard hitting, savage, almost maleviolent and completly awesome guitar sounds;a lead singer who has the ability to put raw, razor-sharp vocals into every lyric sung; and the bands ability to make this all sound natural and smooth. Any one who judges a band soully on it's lyrics and how greatlly written they are should be impaled on a giant, burning spike Vlad style. Disturbed represents all these quallitys and is with out a doubt one of the greatest bands ever. Also people who think Disturbed sold out and became wuss-ified in the belive albums are ignorants pricks not being able to see beyond their bloody dicks from jerking it to much and the fact that just because something is not mindlessy violent does not mean it is not kick-ass metal. word is bond bitches.|||plates on ur ass bitch!!PLATES ON UR ASS!!!!= mindlessy violen= kick-ass get up come on get down with the sickness!!=anthem of rockers,goths and punks every where i'm not willing to die girl because of what u dont tell me, i'm not willing to compromise the man i want to be!=full of meaning and not wussified you ass pricks|||1229,445

Anacronym|||1. An acronym created by a small, isolated group with the intent of increasing the celerity of text-based communication. Such an acronym suffers from the same problems as and can include workspace jargon. Anacronyms commonly, but not always result from putting two or more of the following types of people in a chatroom: computer programmers, MMORPG players (case in point), pre-pubescent females, GI's, and/or slow typists.The irony of such an acronym demonstrates itself because of the acronym's tendency towards the specific and arcane. Namely, an individual desensitized to the use of the acronym (not exceedingly dissimilar to the individual who no longer notices his/her own swearing) will attempt to use the acronym in a textual conversation with an individual not familiar with the group of individuals or the acronym in question. This invariably leads to a message of one or more marks of interrogative punctuation by the uninformed party. Taking the time to explain the meaning of the letter sequence, the informed party defeats the intended purpose of the acronym by possibly increasing the length of text sent by upwards of four lines.2. A usually nonverbalized acronym which has been verbalized. This is considered a taboo in most situations. The individuals to whom the offending party has "anacronyzed" will most likely look incredulously at the offender.3. A completely unnecessary acronym. Almost every acronym in this third definition pertains to the first definition.4. A misused acronym.|||1. The following is a textual conversation:Friend A: So then I jumped off of the roof!Friend B: WAYTTP?Friend A: ?????????????Friend B: What Are You Trying To Prove?Friend A: Well, why didn't you just say that to begin with?Friend B: I thought you knew that one.Friend A: I don't play Counter Strike.

Kiss My Ass Guys, You're On Your OwnAmusing, but useless.4. The following conversation is textual:Lover A: Do you want to go to the dance/ice cream social/moon with me?Lover B: WTF?Lover A: That caustic reply has caused me to mutilate myself/be emotionally scarred for life/commit suicide.Lover B: Why did you overreact so much/decide to text me that you have killed yourself/not know that WTF means Why That sounds Fantastic?The following is assumed:Lover A can not come to their computer now because they are cutting their wrists/crying in a corner/dead.|||5,6

acai berry|||Acai is a Brazilian berry original from the Amazon Region that is considered to be one of nature's most complete and healthy foods.The history of the berry from the Brazilian Amazon that is changing the concept of healthy food. Acai (açaí - a-sigh-ee) is a palm tree that grows in the North of Brazil. It is known by the native people (indigenas) as "içá-çai", which means “fruit that cries”. The Acai tree can be found all over the Amazonia region. To make Acai Roots, juice is extracted from the pulp of the skin of the seed. No trees are harmed in the process. For hundreds of years, acai (açaí) has been a traditional food of the native people of the Amazon – and part of its folklore, finding its way into legend as well as onto the table. Once upon a time, there was an Amazon Indian girl named Iaca, whose father was the tribal chief. His tribe had grown so large that there wasn’t enough food to go around. So, the chief decreed that all newborn babies must be killed. When Iaca, his own daughter, bore a child, the chief had his decree carried out. Iaca mourned her baby’s death alone in her hut for days. Then she thought she heard a baby crying. When she went outside in search of the baby, she saw a palm tree shooting up from the earth, covered in fruit. Full of despair, she lay down under the tree and died. The next day, the tribe found Iaca’s body under the new tree. The tree’s fruit satisfied their hunger and renewed their energy, and the chief lifted his harsh decree, declaring that the fruit would be named after his daughter (“Acai” is “Iaca” spelled backwards). With abundant food for all, the tribe grew and flourished. Acai has been enjoyed for decades by the people of Brazil. A bowl of Acai is usually eaten in the morning with breakfast. In the 1950’s, doctors began to realize the health benefits of Acai. In the 1960’s, the famous Gracie jiu-jitsu family recommended eating Acai before and after workouts. Recently, several new medical studies in the United States and Europe have found even more exciting health benefits of Acai.|||Acai berry (singular)acai berries (plural)|||18,11

ballet|||The earliest known origins of ballets were lavish entertainments given in the courts of Renaissance Italy. The Italian court ballets were further developed in France. Le Ballet Comique de la Reine (The Queen's Ballet Comedy), the first ballet for which a complete score survived, was performed in Paris in 1581. Most French court ballets consisted of dance scenes linked by a minimum of plot. Because they were designed principally for the entertainment of the aristocracy, rich costumes, scenery, and elaborate stage effects were emphasized. In 1661 Louis XIV established the Acad‚mie Royale de Danse, a professional organization for dancing masters. He himself stopped dancing in 1670, and his courtiers followed his example. By then the court was already giving way to professional dancing. At first all the dancers were men, and men in masks danced women's roles. The first female dancers to perform professionally in a theater production appeared (1681) in Le Triomphe de l'Amour (The Triumph of Love).Eighteenth-century dancers were encumbered by masks, wigs or large headdresses, and heeled shoes. Women wore panniers, hoopskirts draped at the sides for fullness. Men often wore the tonnelet, a knee-length hoopskirt. Despite the brilliance of the French dancers, choreographers working outside Paris achieved more dramatic expression. In London the English choreographer John Weaver eliminated words and tried to convey dramatic action through dance and pantomime. In Vienna the Austrian choreographer Franz Hilverding and his Italian pupil Gasparo Angiolini experimented with dramatic themes and gestures. La Sylphide, first performed in Paris in 1832, introduced the period of the romantic ballet.Women dominated this period. Although good male dancers such as the Frenchmen Jules Perrot and Arthur Saint-L‚on were performing, they were eclipsed by ballerinas such as Taglioni, Elssler, the Italians Carlotta Grisi and Fanny Cerrito, and others.In the 1920s and 1930s, modern dance began to be developed in the United States and Germany. Two great American companies were founded in New York City in the 1940s, American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet. The latter drew many of its dancers from the School of American Ballet established by Balanchine and Kirstein in 1934. Since the mid-20th century, companies have been founded in many cities throughout the United States and in Canada, among them: the National Ballet of Canada, in Toronto (1951); Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, in Montreal (1952); the Pennsylvania Ballet, in Philadelphia (1963); and the Houston Ballet (1963).Beginning in 1956, Russian companies such as the Bolshoi and Kirov performed in the West for the first time. The intense dramatic feeling and technical virtuosity of the Russians made a great impact. Russian influence continues today, both through visits from Russian companies and the activities of defecting Soviet dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev, artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet from 1983 to 1989; Natalia Makarova; and Mikhail Baryshnikov, director of the American Ballet Theatre, New York City, from 1980 to 1989.Dance in general underwent an enormous upsurge in popularity beginning in the mid-1960s. It began to show the influence of a younger audience, in both themes and style. The athleticism of dancing was enjoyed in much the same way as sports, and virtuosic steps were admired for their challenge and daring. Popular music such as rock and roll and jazz was used to accompany many ballets. Today's ballet repertoire offers great variety. New repertoire and reconstructions and restagings of older ballets coexist with new works created by modern-dance choreographers for companies. Choreographers experiment with both new and traditional forms and styles, and dancers constantly seek to extend their technical and dramatic range. The frequent tours of companies allow audiences throughout the world to experience the full spectrum of today's ballet activity.|||Swan Lake...Romeo and Juliet...Giselle...|||263,77

But, I suspected this, and at least through them; that they also use it in a different condanation. They also use it when they are 'Ire" as in feeling irate, irrated. I have asked them personally; and have witnessed their reactions they are expressing while under diress.      They have explained to me when I inquired just to find out for myself; that it has a dual meaning; for them at least. I am not sure how prevelant this is in regard to statistical determinations. But, this is what they told me. They surely used it freely and openly while seriously irritaded and upset. So, in a nutshell, from what I have seen, it is for some a dual meeting term.|||It is similar to the Non Racist Trad Skins. (or at least it used to when it was more participated in.)

It can also commonly be heard from conception used as "He's got the "suss" ; in turn, insinuating a seemingly sounding contradictory statement as it would mean to "declare, question and affirm" anothers' validity.

Biddies|||"Biddy" is actually a very interesting word because it has two separate origins, both fairly well-documented, which is unusual for a slang term. The primary meaning of "biddy" is "chicken," and it first appeared in the early 17th century. The word probably came from the nonsense syllables used to call chickens -- something like "here biddybiddybiddy," I suppose. By the late 18th century "biddy" had been adopted as a derogatory slang term for women, much in the same unfortunate way that "chick" was in the 1960's. However, "biddy" in this sense might have died a welcome death had it not been for the influx of Irish immigrants into the U.S. in the early 19th century. Young Irish women often had their passage paid by upper-class American families, for whom they would then work as domestic servants while they paid off their debt. The practice was so widespread that such women came to be known as "Biddies," from a shortening of "Bridget," a common Irish women's name. This use of "biddie" reinvigorated the word, and ever since it has been employed by insolent children to torment their elders.Sometime in the last 20 years or so, the term was recycled to mean a woman of any age.  The connotation may exemplify the earliest expression synonymous with the concept now known as MILF.|||"The old biddy is playing bridge" or "I'm trying to pick up a biddy"|||412,284

industrial revolution|||The period of technological innovation in the world that began in England in the 1800s and spread to America during the Reconstruction Era immediately after the Civil War. One major effect was the genesis of middle class America as people took jobs in emerging industries and new industrial plants. Before the industrial revolution there were only two social classes in the United States: wealthy (many were slave owners) and poor agrarian families. The wealthy at that time were hardly wealthy by today’s standards. It’s believed that the invention of the printing press sparked the revolution, leading to the creation of the steam engine, followed by industrial plants and technological innovation. The industrial revolution then sparked the emergence of big business and capitalism as people found employment opportunities in new industries and industrial plants, attracting people to urban areas. The textile industry, mining, the pharmaceutical industry and  healthcare, the insurance industry, power plants, retail industries and the steel industry are just a few industries that emerged during the industrial revolution. Thanks to the emergence of the steel industry, the world’s first “skyscraper” emerged in Chicago in the 1880s. Then came the invention of the car by Elwood Hayes of Kokomo, Indiana; and the airplane by the Wright Brothers of Ohio; and then television and radio; and then the rocket by Robert Goddard and the space age; the birth of the microchip and the computer; mass communications, and then Big Brother and the internet--all of these were effects of the industrial revolution that greatly changed our society and lead to the current “second industrial revolution.” In less than a century mankind went from being a strictly agrarian, slave-owning society to landing on the moon. Key events during the Revolution: The invention of the lightbulb and phonograph by Thomas Edison, the invention of the telgraph by Samuel F.B. Morse, the invention of pills and elixirs by Colonel Eli Lilly (Eli Lilly and Co. pharmaceuticals), the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell, the beginning of the retail industry with Sears-Roebuck, the unification of America's railroad in Promontory Point, Utah, Andrew Carnegie and the Steel Industry, John Rockefeller and the oil industry, etc.|||From the Garden of Eden to the mid 1800s, the world changed very little.

fix|||The proper term for a single gear fixed wheel bicycle. These bikes were traditionally home made by the users; they would take a traditional 10 speed frame toss out the hanging derailleur and remove the 5 speed fly wheel and replace it with a single speed "fixed" hub. These bikes were most popular among NYC bike messengers in the 70's, 80s, and early 90's because of their low maintenance and lighter weight; many users would have only a front brake or forgo brakes totally because you can control the bikes momentum solely suing your feet. These bikes were not for the lazy or lighthearted because they require a much more skilful and alert riding style as well as perpetual motion because the is no "free" spin mode.The Fix could be brought out right in those days at some bike stores by asking for a racing bike. Racing bikes were usually made by Bianchi or Lotus and sported rear facing dropouts for the back wheel; these store bought Fix bikes were uncommon for the average fix rider and primarily purchased by bike messengers.The majority of serous road bike riders, then and now, use geared bikes.Today people are calling bikes like this "Fixies"; there was no such term ( fixie ) being used on the streets in 1970's thru early 90's.Fixie should be used to describe store bought bicycles many of which do not even have fixed flywheels.|||Yo, check out how Joe is riding his Fix.Joe has a Fix with no brakes.|||6,5

zeon|||Quite possibly the most determined Anime faction of all time. Beginning their saga with Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeon forces have been defeated after coming back yet again in close to half of all Mobile Suit Gundam spin-offs. The faction itself is basically the Nazis in space, with each new series trying to make it even more clear (Until the latest Gundam series, Gundam Unicorn which abandoned subtlety altogether and just gave their giant robots Nazi helmets and weaponry). Zeon began as a movement to liberate the space colonies from the rule of the Earth Federation and create an independent nation in space. However, their rulers read a little bit too much of 'Mein Kampf' and decided to go on sprees of what many of us refer to as 'War Crimes', even going so far as to gas a colony full of civilians and then drop the thing onto the earth, resulting in a crater over 500 miles wide. Then they did that a few more times. Point is, they like making things explode and their leaders tend not to have too strong a grasp on this whole 'Morality' thing everyone keeps going on about. Despite the fact that the producers keep trying to make them evil, the fanbase of Zeon seems to be larger than that of the federation. More than likely this is because they always get the cool toys and tend to have more badass characters. Like Char, the Red Comet who manages to be one of Anime's most memorable villains.|||The Principality of Zeon are the main antagonists the Universal CenturyZeon has most the cool Mobile Suits, like the Zaku.Man, I can't believe Zeon's back again.

There are mixed views as to exactly what a Golem looks like, but the general view is that a Golem is large, perhaps larger than a human, and is covered in a rocky mass. It is not all that pretty, and sometimes features a rather ugly mouth. Golems seem to be submissive creatures, as they never really act on their own, and are controlled by whoever Summons/Finds them. Thus, they are not necessarily good or evil in spite of their evil-ish appearance.|||"GOLEM used Rock Slide!" -Pokémon"Um, so... A mad scientist is making a... Golem. No! A Flesh Golem, yeah.

rose petal|||A submissive girl who is extremely feminine/delicate and seeks full-time or near-full-time d/s relationships where any "BDSM play" is light and the focus is on the emotional aspects of the relationship. Rose petals often openly display their kink because they do not see it as provocative, unlike the lifestyle of most other submissives (babygirls, slaves, sissies, etc.) This is most commonly shown through the use of accessories such as lace choker necklaces and jewelry featuring a lock.Rose petals strive to be the romantic interests we see in Victorian/Edwardian and fantasy literature, who are typically reserved and graceful. Unlike many other submissives, rose petals do not enjoy being severely hurt, degraded, or humiliated by their dominant partners. In their eyes, dominant/submissive relationships are beautiful and romantic, and should not be tainted in such ways. This type of submissive woman most often seeks a dominant who is also sophisticated and romantic, but has a dark and mysterious edge. When with the right type of partner for them, the rose petal can become very service-oriented and nurturing/soothing. In return, they seek emotional guidance and safety.Not to be confused with submissive wives, babygirls, "little girl" subs, "occasional" kinksters, or vanilla women who happen to be especially feminine. It is also worth noting that rose petals value themselves just as highly as their dominant partners, so they do not commonly use titles or pronoun capitalization.|||Person 1: "How are things going with your new submissive girlfriend?"Person 2: "Not like I expected, dude.

honeymoon|||The word "honeymoon" first appeared in English in the 1500s. The first citation of the word appeared in a 1552 glossary printed in England, called Abcedarium Anglico Latinum.   "Honeymoon" is derived from the ancient Germanic custom of having newly-weds drink mead (the 'drink of love') for a whole moon (month) in order to encourage fertility, and a male child in particular.  The history of mead has roots in royalty, religion, sex, and violence throughout the ages of time and cultures of the world. Mead is almost certainly the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man and likely discovered before the wheel was invented.  Mead has for centuries been renowned as an aphrodisiac, and mead's real claim to fame is in its origins in wedding celebrations, hence the word "honeymoon."  Mead was traditionally drunk during the month-long celebrations following weddings to insure fertility and the birth of sons. Some customs sent the bride to bed and then filled the bridegroom with mead until he could no longer stand. He was then delivered to the bride's bedside to sire a son that very night. If, per chance, the bride did, in fact, bear a son nine months later, the maker of the mead was complimented on its quality.|||Jason: How was your honeymoon, Jack?Jack: Super! Drank lots of honey and made passionate love to Jill for a full month. She is now pregnant with our first baby boy.|||89,41
honeymoon|||It was the accepted practice in Babylonia 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink.  Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the honey month, which eventually came to be known as the honeymoon.|||Credit - www.alaskanbeer.com|||125,88

The top — usually blond — is sculpted into a studied muss of short and manly waves (this works best if the hair in question tends to curl or even ’fro at longer lengths) cemented in place with mondo amounts of product. The face beneath is clean-shaven, except for a strategically cultivated tuft groomed to adorn the curve of an otherwise stubble-free chin.|||“Man, when I was out in Arizona last weekend, I couldn’t believe all the whipsters around.

They are popular in densely populated areas where there is no room available to put trash in landfills. Some concerns with incinerators include the production of dioxins, which are highly toxic. Many environmentalists believe that incinerators have no place in modern society. Others believe that they are important because we cannot recycle all waste and that properly operated incinerators are quite safe.|||In countries such as The Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark, most waste is recycled.

existentialist|||(n.) One who follows the philosophy of existentialism.  Existentialists get a bad rap due to the fact that some retards treat it as if it's a philosophy of despair. However, it's quite the contrary. While the philosophy does state that life has no meaning, the notion is not intended to make the individual powerless, but rather empowered to live life with a sense of exuberance and accomplishment in order to give meaning to his/her existence. Furthermore, existentialism emphasizes individuality and personal responsibility for the ramifications that come with being an individual. Since the individual possesses the freedom of choice to choose his/her experiences and non-experiences, he/she is solely the one responsible for the consequences that come with these actions and non-actions. In layman's terms, you shouldn't be a bitch and direct the finger of blame at somebody else for the shitty decisions you make in the process of finding yourself. (adj.) Genearlly, a bullshit term the valley girls of the intellectual world will apply to describe, fallaciously(!!!), something synonymous to "angsty/edgy but, still, like, totally cool." These sentiments further tarnish the existentialist movement.|||1. See also: The works of Jean Paul Sartre.2. Ohmigawd, your lj poetry is, like, sOoO giving me an existentialist vibe.|||245,25

ludicrosity|||In early 1999, myself and fellow independant filmaker, Emery Noel of manchester NH USA co-wrote a film named "ludicrosity." The plot was about 4 guys who were going nowhere in their lives until the discovered the risks and thrills of comic terrorism- unfortunatly we were at about 75% complete primary shooting of our footage on 9/11/01, and the project had to be scrapped in the tense weeks that followed. Filmaker's insurance skyrocketed, police participation was nil and several locations backed out. Though we copyrighted the title believing that in fact we had created the word circa summer 1999, I am not laying individual claim to it other than as the title to our film. Thought that may be interesting to someone somewhere out there at some time, who enjoys the word.

Series Finale|||(N.) The final episode of a TV series where all mysteries are solved and all questions are usually answered.  Most Series Finales come from arrogant networks canceling their time-tested quality shows for "New Viewers" and do not happen by choice. Only when a long-overdue-for-canceling show (Like "Friends") decides to actually stop doing episodes anymore, are Series Finales by choice. A Series Finale doesn't count if a show has been on for less than One Season, or 13-22 episodes. So "The Will", "DotComedy", or "Life On A Stick" would not offically have a "Series Finale."|||Beginning in 2004, networks started to cancel at least one of their top-rated TV shows, in order to boost ratings for next season. So when The WB's "Angel", UPN's "Star Trek: Enterprise" and Fox's "24" had their Series Finales, they weren't going to come back next year. EVER.|||9,2

Irv|||IRV, which stands for "Instant-Runoff Voting", is a type of voting for single-winner elections in which voters NUMBER their ballots according to their preferences (IE "1" for top candidate, "2" for their second-favorite candidate, etc.), rather than mark one with an "X" by his/her name. Candidates must get a 50%+1 majority in order to be declared elected.  If nobody achieves said majority, then the candidate with the least amount of votes is dropped off and his/her votes transferred to other candidates until one candidate wins. The intention is that a candidate has an absolute majority without any of the following: 1.  tactical voting (voting for a major candidate so that a reviled candidate doesn't win)2.  spoiler effect (a third-party candidate "taking votes" from a major candidate)3.  negative campaigning (where candidates campaign so that it's like "Vote for me and nobody else." -- INSTEAD, candidates would say, "In case I'm eliminated, make sure to send your votes to him/her.") IRV was invented in 1870 by William Robert Ware (a U.S. American architect), who based it on the single-winner version of the multi-winner Single Transferable Vote, which itself was invented by Carl Andrae (a Danish politician and mathematician) and shaped by Thomas Hare (an English lawyer). In national politics, IRV is used in the following countries (There may be more, but here's what I found so far.): ~ Australia (Australian House of Representatives; by the way, Australia's notorious for demanding that voters rank ALL of the candidates in order for a vote to be considered valid)~ Ireland (Irish Presidency; Ireland's small and doesn't have to resort to an electoral college like the U.S.)~ Fiji (Fijian House of Representatives) Other names that IRV goes by are Alternative Voting, Preferential Voting, Ranked-Choice Voting, the Hare System (after Thomas Hare), and Ware's Method (after William Robert Ware). ((I'm not 100% sure if Urban Dictionary would approve of me listing websites here for informational and education purposes, but...)) For more information on IRV, you can visit http://www.instantrunoff.com/. SOURCES USED:~ Instant-Runoff Voting @ Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRV/)~ Instant Runoff Voting (http://www.instantrunoffvoting.com/)|||Here's a sample of what a voter's ballot would look like when using IRV: Alex = 5Jane = 1Chris = 3Sue = 4Rudy = 2 If Jane (ranked #1) has the least amount of votes, then she gets eliminated and this voter's ballot would go to Rudy (ranked #2) until one of the four remaining candidates (Alex, Chris, Sue, and Rudy) wins or gets eliminated and so on.|||17,9

purple drank|||Purple Drank is an illegal recreational drink popular in the Southern United States rap community, whose main ingredients originally consisted of prescription strength cough syrup, containing codeine and promethazine, and either a carbonated soft drink (generally Sprite) or fruit juice. The purple-ish hue of Purple Drank comes from the dyes in the cough syrup. Recently, the term has expanded to cover mixtures including over-the-counter cough syrup and vodka in place of prescription cough syrup. Other terms for Purple Drank include Barre, Oil, Purple Tonic, Lean (or Southern Lean,) Drank, and Syrup (which is sometimes slangly pronounced as Sizzurp.) The active ingredient of purple drank is codeine, an opiate medication contained in prescription strength cough syrups due to its antitussive properties. Some prescription cough syrups also contain anti-histamine medications, such as promethazine, which have a mild sedative effect. When taken in large quantities, both medications can lead to sedation and altered levels of consciousness. Houston producer DJ Screw first popularized the concoction, which is widely attributed as a source of inspiration for the "chopped & screwed" style of hip hop music. Originally, the active ingredient of "Syrup" was cough syrup containing promethazine and codeine. The concoction first gained popularity in the underground Houston, Texas rap scene and later spread to other southern states.|||"purple drank made ma bank" "drank up in ma cup, mayne hold up" "purple in ma soda" "barre baby" "purple tonic got me leanin"|||1419,551

purple drank|||Purple Drank is a intoxicating beverage also known by the names lean, sizzurp, and liquid codeine. It is commonly abused by southern rappers and wannabe suburban teenagers. It is a mixture of Promethazine/Codeine cough syrup and sprite, with a few jolly ranchers and/or skittles thrown in. Promethazine with codeine, consumed in such large amounts as is popular with such southern rappers as lil wayne, slim thug, and Big Moe, produces an opiate-like high that is potentiated by the Promethazine. Promethazine by itself will not produce a high. The beverage must be sipped slowly, and not guzzled, in order to avoid unconciousness and/or life threatening overdose.  Purple Drank must be served in a styrofoam cup, otherwise it will not be considered Purple Drank by the majority of the Purple Drank abusing community. Purple Drank is NOT:-ANY SYRUP CONTAINING DEXTROMETHORPHAN-Hydrocodone with Promethazine-Any syrup containing ANY drug ingredient other than Promethazine and codeine.-Liquid Codeine. Purple drank is codeine dissolved in syrup. The codeine molecules are not actually in the liquid phase.|||My cup is filled with tha purple drank|||166,81
purple drank|||A recreational leaning drink- an alternative to illegal drugs in pure form- that is common in parties and originated in the south.  It generally consists of around two fluid ounces of promethazine/codeine cough syrup, 8 or more ounces of lemon-lime soda (Sprite, Sierra Mist, 7up, Mountain Dew, Fresca, etc), and jolly ranchers for flavor. It is called 'purple drank' for a) the purple color that the dye in the syrup gives it, and b) the southern pronunciation of the word 'drink'.  It was created around the time when chopped & screwed rap music hit the scene, where the drink went well with the music considering it induced a similar 'slow' and 'leaning' feeling in the consumer. The beverage until recently, however, did not become popular on a wider scale, and originally was almost completely limited and known (for that matter) to the southern regions of the USA.  Purple drank has more street names, the most popular being Lean and Sizzurp.|||"Mike Jones keeps purple drank in his cup." "Dude, that drank got me leanin' last night."

Libyans are generally of the Islamic persuasion and the Arabic invasion of a few centuries ago has left its mark.  Libya has a history of occupation from the Romans to the Facist Italians who proudly pounced on the then relatively impotent state-ish leftover of the bygone Ottomans.  After 1949 Lybians became the subjects of a king, then the onlookers of a coup and are now politically repressed supposed supporters of the Qaddafi regime who is competing with Egypt's Mubarak as the longest running leader with universal support (Saddam currently holds the record..methinks)...

clicker|||television remote control; term dates from the late 1960s when the first tv remotes made a loud click when the buttons were pressed (because they sent an audible high-pitched noise to a microphone in the tv which would then change channels or volume. The click was actually a small hammer inside the remote that struck a small metal tube which made it resonate. Each button on the remote had it's own tube.) The type was discontinued due to the fact that someone dropping their keys or the phone ringing would cause the tv to go crazy and change channels by itself.|||I can't find the clicker.

pegging|||When a woman fucks a man in the ass with a strap-on dildo. It's definitely a very touchy practice, especially in the straight male community. It is often thought of as a homosexual sex act. However, this is not true. Straight men often think that their dominance and masculinity will be in jeopardy if they even think about anything "gay" at all, let alone a female fucking them with a rubber dick. Pegging is not a gay thing whatsoever. No matter how you take it apart and put it back together, it is still sex between a man and a woman. In other words; straight sex. It is certainly enjoyable, given that the right amount of communication and comfort were considered. It is typically not a good idea to surprise a man by simply walking out of the bathroom with a strap-on dildo equipped and ready to use. This will probably lead to rejection and discomfort. The truth is that anal play, no matter what gender, is enjoyable if performed correctly. The ass has a shitload of nerve endings that will feel fucking amazing if stimulated properly and with plenty of lube. It probably feels better for a man to receive anal sex rather than a woman due to the prostate gland inside the male ass. I shit you not, an orgasm can be achieved by directly touching and stimulating the prostate gland without any need for touching the penis at all. And it feels out of this fucking world amazing.|||John - Hey, Julia, wanna fuck?Julia - Okay, John! I'll ride you! I'm so wet!John - No, I was talking about pegging me!Julia - Oh!

SoVA|||southern Virginia. soVa keeps up Virginia's  reputation of a sweet ass state.  By excluding noVA (norther Virginia), Virginia is able to sustain its prestige that has existen since the first landing in 1607.  While western Virginia and central Virginia are not very important, soVa is represented by the tidewater region bordering North Carolina.  Most notably are the beach kids from Virginia Beach that keep it real with the surf culture.  Virginia Beach hosts the East Coast Surfing Championship every year, the largest surfing competition on the entire East Coast.  soVa specifically destinguishes itself from noVa because noVa kids are stuck up riches that pretend to be fly becuase they flaunt their money. In actuallity, the entire state of Virginia dislikes noVa but cannot get rid of it due to the proximity to Washington D.C. soVa has a completely different life style from the rest of Virginia.

SoVA|||"SOVA" stands for "Save Our Voice Actors" A cult of fanatical worshipers of the 4Kids production of the Pokemon anime.They consider 4Kids to be sacred and the 4Kids voice cast to be deities. They have spent the last three years trolling the Pokemon anime on various fansites, harassing the cast members and the companies behind the show, even threatening violence and acts of terrorism. They are responsible for inciting many flamewars in the Pokemon fandom and have been essentially exiled for their fanatical antics. No respectable or reasonable fan of Pokemon wants anything to do with SOVA. They can be seen most actively on YouTube where they make low-quality AMVs, and crappy fandubs heaping praise upon the 4Kids cast, and demonizing the current cast. They will also vote down, and toll the comments of various clips of the Pokemon anime from seasons 9 onwards. All this is in an attempt to draw new members into their cult to keep their insane campaign of trolling, harassing, and general fanaticism. The sad truth behind this is, that SOVA was started on a lie told by the members of the 4Kids cast, whom covered up the fact that they have contractual obligations to 4Kids, and could not break the non-compete clause in their contracts without being blacklisted from all future work at 4Kids. Even after learning these facts, SOVA dismissed them as lies and continued on their crusade. Now, after three years, the group is fractured and desperate in their efforts. All that remains is the SOVA fundamentalists, who see nothing as too extreme. They have even made efforts exploiting the recent passing of Madeleine Blaustein as a recruiting tool and motivator. SOVA is a group that will continue on this blind rampage until it collapses on itself.|||Oh no, not this SOVA crap again, SOVA Talk is banned!|||22,26
SoVA|||An abbreviation for "Southern Virginia". Most refer to the Hampton Roads area encompassing the lower Tidewater regions as SoVa. In actuality, SoVA includes regions in Virginia south of Richmond, regardless of east or west direction. SoVA is characterized by high unemployment, poor education, abundant crime, and prime natural disaster territory. It has little creativity due to Northern Virginia previously coining "NoVA" to reference their own area. SoVA is jealous of NoVA’s proximity to bordering Washington, D.C., its affluent status, top-rated schools, extensive transportation networks, etc. For every state tax dollar NoVA residents send to Richmond, only 25 cents return for improvements while SoVA uses the remainder of the money to restore extensive slums that depict urban decay. The most populous cities in the state are in SoVA: Virginia Beach (438,000) and Norfolk (243,000). These independent cities hold more land than most other entire counties. Fairfax County in NoVA has 1,081,000 residents within 407 sq mi. Virginia Beach is a whopping 497.3 sq mi. Under Virginia's State Constitution, when a region incorporates itself as a city, it must be independent from a county. If Fairfax County obtains city status the way former Princess Anne County converted to the City of Virginia Beach, it would stand as the fourth most populous city in the United States. Richmond prevents this because NoVA could make more of its own decisions, allowing later separation from the state.|||Foriegn European Tourist: Excuse me, I've noticed that we've landed at an airport in a random area in Virginia to transfer on my way to Washington, D.C.?

IRA|||IRA: Irish Republican Army A guerrila army situated in ireland, whose operations have been concentrated in the occupied north of ireland and on the foreign British mainland.Their main aim is to secure a united ireland which would involve driving out the british forces from the island of ireland. they had the support of many citizens of ireland mostly from the catholic nationalst community.  The organisation follows in the footsteps of a long line of armed revolution in Ireland, including a revolution mounted by Theobald Wolfe Tone, the father of republicanism, who himself was a protestant. During an expansive campaign in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's  the IRA was able to secure large quantities of weapons from the US, the Balkans and Libya. they used these weapons to mount the largest bombing campaign ever seen on the british mainland and gain many concessions and drive the british establishment to the bargaining table. During this time the organisation was able to become the most powerful organisation in Ireland, basically destroying all loyalist organisations in the North and killing hundreds of british soldiers. They also managed to kill two intensively trained SAS soldiers, a major achievement for a volunteer force.The IRA always has taken a hard line against drugs and has been known to kill dealers and importers. they have never used drugs to increase power or funds, unlike all loyalist groups. Recently, after achieving their utmost with violence, the organisation have decided to follow a strictly political path. Support has grown through this initiative and they will achieve a united ireland through this method. weapons have been decommisioned to secure representation of republicans in the government. Despite this, the IRA has the support, if ever there was the need for another armed campaign in Ireland and could wage war indefinitely.|||The IRA are heroes Tiocfaidh ar la Ireland unfree, shall never be at peace- Padraig Pearse|||267,190

It is responsible for the bombings and deaths of many innocent towns and people, mainley the belfast area. Many people have harsh thoughts towards the IRA because they have killed many people. But remember that as far back as the 1600's, the English had been treating the Irish people like shit (Oliver Cromwell, for example), seeing them as the subhuman race, and over the course of almost 400 years of tyranny and oppresion, killed more Irish people than the IRA would ever dream of killing English people. So the Irish do have a reason to be pissed off.|||Englands been fuckin' with us for more than 400 years, and the IRA has put its foot down to that|||209,158

Obviously, only the most naive geeks fall for this.|||Warner Bros. sure is cynical to expect us to find the geek chic added to Clark Kent in Smallville plausible when the actor was an underwear model.|||80,36

geek chic|||Geek Chic is a recent (retarded) trend that has popped up everywhere. First starting with hipsters, but like everything hipsters do, it has gone mainstream. Everyone thinks they're a geek now because the have a Facebook or own a high tech phone. Geek Chic has nothing to to with actual geeks, seeing as real geeks could care less about fashion and a lot of them think it's a vapid hobby.Geek Chic within it's self is an oxymoron and ironic twist of events by people who are generally not geeks, attractive men and women who want to act like geeks but don't actually have the passion for geeky hobbies or the intellect. Real geeks got picked on, and were proud to call themselves geeks because they could construct their own PCs or were very good at math or something, not because they spend massive abouts of times on Xbox play Call Of Duty or in some consumer electronic like an iPod or iPhone. Real geeks consider iPods and iPhones basic shit.|||Kate is the most popular hottest chick in school yet she fakes like she's a geek in Geek Chic.

It is quite common to find five or six offspring in each family group, often with a different father for each new baby. Their habitat consists of a weatherboard or brick-veneer dwelling and is characterised by an early-model Holden or Ford in the driveway surrounded by a group of males discussing why the carby is stuffed and the results of last night's footy (a primitive gladiator-like spectator sport enjoyed by most bogans).The female of the species, while smaller in stature, is far more loud and aggressive than the male. While the males tend to be very friendly and congregate with other males, the females spend most of their time in supermarkets and shopping malls, using a shrill high-pitched call to discipline their children and contact other females. Males and females rarely interact socially except during breeding season, which is otherwise known as Friday night. During this time, females are allowed to enter the male-dominated area known as "the pub" and display their impressive coloured plumage to a prospective mate.Herein lies an intersting phenomenon. Males will often fight over a particularly attractive female and she will mate with only one male, while some less attractive females have been known to have several partners simultaneously. Ahhhh. The wonders of nature.|||Chris Franklin, Eric Bana as "Poita" on Fast Forward, most of Campbelltown.|||5718,780

brainwashed|||(adj.; n. brainwashing) Coerced or manipulated by any number of social, intellectual, and psycho-emotional methods, to do or accept things you wouldn't have otherwise.  It is often an extension of common, everyday persuasion, but goes beyond it to control the way a person thinks and responds in general to limit critical thinking itself, not simply selling a single idea or decision based on presenting information and choice.   The goal of brainwashing is the internalization of the (unrealized or unrecognized) abusive control to where you believe and feel it necessary to enforce someone else's will as your own, unaware of your lack of free will, and usually with an illusion of stronger free will. It goes beyond Stockholm Syndrome by having fear or doubt with regards to criticism about the authority (person, group and/or system of belief).  Rationalizations are given to you to explain away anything contradictory.   The common use of the term implies a blind spot where you cannot see an opposing point of view because of some control or conditioning.  Contradictory facts cannot be processed (mental scotomization), or are warped to fit into a form that no longer contradicts (cognitive dissonance).   Unlike simple indoctrination into many religions or philosophies, brainwashing goes beyond education to include reasons and/or phobias why questioning or turning away from it is wrong and people who do not agree are deceived, evil, or just wrong.  Some religious and other groups cross the line; many do not. People can brainwash themselves by being closed-minded, but can be brainwashed intentionally or unintentionally in any abusive relationship, such as a totally dominating partner, parent, or even a company or organization. This is the primary common use of the word to describe the control process of a cult.  However, brainwashing takes diverse forms in terms of tools and degrees of different kinds of control, so saying a group doesn't do brainwashing because of dissimilarities with another group (dressing all the same, or chanting for hours, for example) is invalid -- and a typical defense by people in a cult. In fact, brainwashing can mean closing the mind when it comes to specific things and not others.  Some cults disguise their control by encouraging you to believe anything you want, including staying in your current religion, so long as it does not interfere and you do not question and commit to the group's agenda. The problem is that the word can be meant or taken as an insult instead of a particular psychological phenomenon.  It may be an excuse to explain why someone cannot see your own point of view.  Therefore, people who are brainwashed are likely to accuse others and even the whole surrounding society of being brainwashed. Brainwashing is also a term that cults use to attack religions in general (many of which may have cult characteristics in varying degrees as a natural development tendency of any social group), or religions that are different in basic dogma from their own.  Some anti-cult organizations have a cultic mentality themselves and therefore have made it difficult for other groups to advocate and educate about the real psychopathology of brainwashing.  In other words, people fall back on the archaic denotation of the word "cult" as "religious sect" and associate brainwashing in terms of belief and not manipulation and control, or blur the distinction between brainwashing and educative indoctrination. In the end things get really sticky, as modern cults have perfected various techniques and tactics, the most ironic of which is to play the role of an organization promoting free will and fighting against what they conveniently define as brainwashing to not include their own mind control.  A common variation of this tactic is declaring the term brainwashing meaningless or even an offensive form of bigotry against religious freedom -- the ultimate and "politically correct" way to silence critics by putting themselves in the role of victim instead of the society they are themselves victimizing.|||How can you defend him after the way he controls your life?  You must be brainwashed. You must be pretty brainwashed to take out a second mortgage to attend those "self-help" courses.

Gang Rape|||Traditionally the term Gang Rape has been used exclusively to describe the act of a large group of people sexually violating an individual; however, in recent times this term has also evolved to include the act of an individual raping an entire gang.While logistically far more challenging, the cumulative incidence of rape is far higher for the perpetrator making this crime arguably more rewarding and convenient for today's busy rapist.Conversely gang rapees may feel intense shame having had their entire gang violated by a single Gang Raper (GR), which has lead this crime being grossly underreported.Due to the technical difficulties encountered in raping an entire gang, a GR must carefully consider their methods and means. Rohypnol, Ketamine and Normison are often cited as reliable tools for this typically challenging situation.|||Bob, "Lucy, Frankie, Renee and Gang, welcome to my house I'm so glad you could all make it to my mulled wine party.

plato|||Ancient philosopher who propounded his theory of the Forms, a core philosophy based upon a fundamental belief in unchangeable perfect eternals from which everything in the phenomenal world is manifested as mere reflections or exact relations.  Plato's idea of the Good, an external form, is the absolute form from which all forms manifest.  And as such, values are objective, says Plato, and a moral gradient exists wherein actions can be said (and judged) as to whether they represent true representations, or false ones, of the Forms. Plato's thoughts on issues of life:- On death/philosophy: Philosophy is the art of dying.  Philosophy itself is the medicine for the soul.  The goal of philosophy is to separate the soul from the body.  And in doing so, philosophy prepares man for death.  Death also brings about recollection of the Forms when the soul part existed among the gods.  Death released the soul back to heaven.- On Justice: Exists when each part -- i.e. in the city-state, or within the soul's cardinal virtues -- does its own part/job.|||Plato's philosophy of Forms constitutes an objective moral world.|||153,37

plato|||One of the original spiders who cast the web in which we have not escaped for 2,400 years was plato. He banished art, making himself the only artist. Only he was a master B.S. artist. He learned from the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians how to enslave man "permanently," unless we can find away out of his Platonic thought and actions. He came up with a world of ideas that he convinced many people existed. Some were downright racist/fascist like his concept of the three metals that we all supposedly had at our essence. Guess who had the "Golden essence." Correct it was Plato. Guess the slave's metal. Right, lead. You too could have this golden essence, if you worked hard for Plato, fought in his army, didn't rock the boat, and paid 40% of your income to fight Plato's wars to kill and enslave your fellow man who was most likely much like you. He was one of the first protection racket politicians. Scare them and they will follow.

pizzly|||Noun; The result of the mating of a grizzly bear and a polar bear. Once thought to be only existent in labs, this creature was discovered in the wild in  2006. Known to be the single most deadly creature ever to exist, Pizzly bears are multiplying fast and spreading, thanks to their tolerance to varied climates, all over the world. Common habitats include forests, artic tundras, cities, deserts, and your closet.  They are on average 7' tall and can weigh as much as 550 lbs. Pizzlies are characterized by white fur, long claws, a humped back, a shallow face, and brown patches around its eyes, nose, and back. A mix of two deadly predators, the Pizzly can run -30 mph (meaning can travel 30 miles in one hour BEFORE they leave) and have claws so sharp that by reading this sentence about them you are already bleeding. They are extremely strong and resilient to damage.  Shots fired at Pizzly bears have only shown that they do in fact bleed testosterone. Any reports of a dead Pizzly is just a Pizzly infiltrating our universities and museums (see below).  Pizzly bears are masters of disguise and can easily go undercover as a cab drivers, senators, or news anchors (i.e. Katie Couric). Pizzly bears actively hunt humans for food and for sport, so it is important that when traveling in their habitat (everywhere) you take precautions; draw around yourself a Pizzly bear circle and carry a mixture of one part honey and one part seal blood, thus appealing the appetite of both halves of this creature. This should give you enough time to draft a short will and testament.-warning-Persons denying the existence of Pizzly bears or belittling their danger may in fact be Pizzly bears themselves. Ask them to smile. See their sharp canine teeth? This indicates that they are cubs nearing maturity that are in disguise (see above/CBS evening news)|||"Hey let's take two ridiculously dangerous animals and cross them, then call it a Pizzly""A Pizzly bear killed my (mother/father/sibling/child/priest)""Oh loo-(this is all you have time to say before a Pizzly bear kills you)|||32,9
