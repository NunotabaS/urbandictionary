talk to the hand|||talk to the hand|||interjection|||The phrase "" is a street vocabulary conversation-stopper that is meant to be taken literally,  albeit ironically; and is usually accompanied by its related body language:  I make a pronouncement.  You begin to offer an objection of some sort.  I cut you off by extending my right hand, palm out toward you, while I look over my right shoulder and say, "!"  The implication is that you might as well talk to my hand, because I'm not listening.  As a conversation stopper, it works even better if you've never heard or seen it before, as what is meant may take a moment or two to sink in, and might even have to be explained (making the recipient seem a little less than streetwise).  Since the speaker performs somewhat silly-looking body movements in order to get his/her point across, the phrase is kept just a shade short of being unforgivably rude.  As the phrase is becoming somewhat less obscure, some are jettisoning the body movements, reducing the communication to a more-or-less angry comment meaning I'm not going to listen to you,  as in "Hey, man, !"
