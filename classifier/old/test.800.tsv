n|||jam hot|||The moment you come across a Jamhot, the first thing that comes to your mind is his/her friendly nature. He is what he seems to be. Qualities like subtlety, diplomacy or modesty just don't gel with a Jamhot named person. A Jamhot can be calm, wise and serious, but not before he has gone past youth. Frankness, lack of stability, fear of physical pain, optimism and impulsiveness are some of the basic Jamhot characteristics. One of the warmest and the most generous people, Jamhots always prefer fame to money. Gossip does not interest a Jamhot and for him, people are either black or white, without any shades of grey. There is one thing an Jamhot can never fall short of, conversation. He can speak about anything & everything under the sun. He lives in the present and is a realist, yet believes in miracles. Jamhots chase success, not waiting for it to fall in their lap, and don't accept defeat. Failure can never keep them down.Most of the Jamhot people are involved in business or creative arts or are involved in planning and organization. If a Jamhot does something for you, don't forget to express your gratitude. Otherwise, he will be deeply hurt. However, that would not stop him from helping again. Jamhots usually stick to their opinion and won't listen to anything they do not believe. They have a contemplative side to their personality. The simplicity is blended with the blind passion of a born crusader. Jamhots are mentally strong and always one of the pioneers.|||Jamhot - EntropiaUniverse - Real Life - Everywhere - The Entertainer|||1,1

UltraSoft was featured in books like 'BBS Secrets" from IDG Publishing and others, and in BBS Related articles and on a number of software CDs. A few of the Door Games they produced were Top Ranked Boxing, Animated Backgammon, and Saratoga Raceway. There is also a Drag Strip Game and a High-Speed Indianapolis Oval Track Racing Game.  Since that time they still upgrade their doorgames for BBS systems on Telnet, but also produce a variety of shareware programs for other platforms, such as Windows 95 up through Vista.
