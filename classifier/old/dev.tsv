n|||BAGBAG|||A horrible misspelling of the phrase "HAHAHA".  One day, when the keys "H" and "A" were hit in rapid succession to indicate a large outburst of comedic persuasion by a certain young man, the word BAGBAG appeared by some miracle, and being so swift with his typing movements, the enter key was hit before the chance to edit the word was allowed.  In the process, history was being made.  The word later became of popular use by most of the "cool" kids, and luckily for all never fell into the hands of the members of Precise Squadron.  It is sure it would've faced the same dooms as such greats as "ll" and "GFG" By closer examination it can be seen by the reader that the keys of "B" and "G" are of a relatively close location to the target "H" key.  It appears possible that the typist had missed the "H" four times in one word and instead entered a "B-G-B-G" pattern.  To this day it remains a mystery exactly how much cocaine the typist was on when he misspelled "HAHAHA".|||Van_coke> I just wanted to let you all know I'll be gone for the past few days. tum> BAGBAG Pip> bagbag wtf?|||2,4

g|||sucker's deal|||n. A "sale" price so high that only a sucker would pay it. To pull off a sucker's deal, retailers often display obscenely high rates as "normal" prices so that a discount would seem comparatively low to a hapless shopper, even if the reduced price is significantly higher than market value.   Sucker's deals are easy to spot, often found in fashion malls or department stores with giant red signs advertising "SALE" or "20% OFF" in bold letters.  If a deceptive marketing campaign is executed correctly, the sale items will fly off the shelves, along with their other regularly priced hyper-inflated products.   Of course, this conjob, scam tactic only works on stupid people with lots of disposable income, but apparently there's an abundance of these types in both North America and Europe.  A good rule of thumb to follow is that if a store's advertised SALE price is greater than 20% higher than Internet mail-order market rate (including UPS/Fedex) for exactly the same product, it's a true sucker's deal.|||Sucker:  "I just came back from a huge sale at (insert rip-off designer clothing store here) and got these jeans at half off!"

g|||Hate Group|||Possibly the stupidest idea ever conceived, and it's never used right. Ever.Hate groups are basically some people that dislike something, so they band together into a hate group.The biggest problems with hate groups are:1. Once you hate something enough to band together with a bunch of strangers, there really is no talking you out of it. So 90% of the hate groups' members are intolerant dickheads that will shelve anything you say if it's not exactly their opinion.2. Hate groups often target one small portion on something. So if one guy calls you a fat-fuck inbred and acts like a dumbshit, everyone relating to that person must obviously be that way. Thus, everything positive is heresy.3. Hate groups never really give up (Rick Astley). Combined with the first problem, they will most-likely do anything to convert you to their side. You like a T.V. show I don't? You obviously want to fuck the characters and you instantly gain a few hundred pounds, a neckbeard and have autism. Why? Because I said so.|||Think of all the shitty hate groups out there, like the Westboro Baptist Church. Do you like the WBC? Fuck no. Why? Cause they force shit down everyone's throats. And if you try to talk them out of it, they mentally plug their ears going ALALALALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!!!!! and then tell you to fuck off because having a different opinion is evil. Now, think of all the good hate groups... Which ones? Exactly. There are no 'good' hate groups. Because hatred starts out small, then builds up until you wanna fucking choke somebody, then you go full retard and fuck something completely over until you're banned, arrested or even murdered.Life would be better not with hate groups, but will reasoning. But I'm sorry, we live in the "FUK U U FUCING FAGET #YOLO#SWAG DUBSTEP!!!!! LE FUNEH STUFF LELELELELELEELLELLLELLELE XDXDXDXDXDXDDXDDDDDXDXDXDXDXXDXD" generation.

n|||a day in the life|||Is a song by The Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, composed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney SERIOUSLY!!!, John wrote the beginning and the end and Paul wrote the middle part...two different songs that compliment each other after being merge together...It is considered to be one of the most ambitious, influential, and groundbreaking works in pop music history.. Inspired from a friend of Lennon who died in a car crash with a parked lorry!!! when John read the newspaper..He also read something about filling potholes in Blackburn, Lancashire, but he didn't copy and paste that after taking inspiration he eventually included a little fiction in it...Later it helped fuel the Paul is Dead hoax of the supposed death of Paul...It also took some inspiration from a movie John starred in minor role in called How I Won The War.....The middle section is McCartney's doing...it is about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a reverie, and also contributed the "I'd love to turn you on" part, which is like the chorus of the song.It's working title was "In The Life Of...", and started recording on January 19, 1967. The two sections were separated by 24 bars and  because of this there was a huge gap between them, at this time Lennon was stil unsure how to fill it..The basic track consisted of a simple repeating chord and voice of Mal Evans counting the bars, his voice was treated with increasing echo effect an indication of The Beatles desire of having a crescendo in the section. It ende with an alarm sound triggered by Mal Evans accidentally.. but because it went so well with Paul's piece it was left there..Also because Lennon couldn't find a good verb to put in 'Now they know how many holes it takes to ----- Albert Hall, a friend of his "Terry Doran added 'fill' to it completing the lyrics, eventually they decided to add some growing noise in it..By now the song was refined and remixed and additional parts were added, including the A Day in the Life. However the Beatles still has no solution for their missing section of the song, util McCartney had the idea of having an orchestra "freaking out" for the 24-bar middle section, also George Martin wrote an extended, atonal crescendo score for the musicians to follow because the classically trained musicians couldn't improvise on this. On February 10 it was recorded with a 40-piece orchestra and costed 367 pounds for the players, and at the time was a huge extravegance. Martin later described explaining his improvised score to the puzzled orchestra: "What I did there was to write, at the beginning of the twenty-four bars, the lowest possible note for each of the instruments in the orchestra. At the end of the twenty-four bars, I wrote the highest note each instrument could reach that was near a chord of E major. Then I put a squiggly line right through the twenty-four bars, with reference points to tell them roughly what note they should have reached during each bar... Of course, they all looked at me as though I were completely mad." For all the chaos of the recording session, the results were a brilliant success; in the final edit of the song the orchestral crescendo is reprised, in even more cacophonous fashion, at the conclusion of the song. NEMS Enterprises filmed the session with studio guests like Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Donovan, Pattie Boyd and Michael Nesmith. Because The Beatles like to experiment and avant garde they asked asked to wear a costume piece with their formal attire. Following the final orchestral crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. John, Paul, Ringo Starr, George Martin, and Mal Evans playing an E-major chord on three different pianos at the same time. The sound of the final chord was manipulated to ring out for as long as possible (nearly a minute) by increasing the sound level to the tape as the vibration faded out. This song was recorde a startling 34 hours. After the chord there is a few minutes of silence and then a high-pitched sound comes in to annoy your dog and then the phrase "Never could see any other way, Aha" spliced forwards and backwards together that is looped infinitely if you have the record and your player has no 'auto-return', this was put us a prank by The Beatles for annoying the listener's dog and to suprise those who forgot to turn their player's off.The song placed twelfth on CBC's 50 Tracks, the second highest Beatles song on the list, second to "In My Life", and also placed 26th on the Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the 500 best songs of all time. It was placed first in Q Magazine's list of the 50 greatest British songs of all time, and also came top of Mojo Magazine's 101 Greatest Beatles Songs, as decided by a panel of musicians and journalists.To put it simply it is the most ambitious and groundbreaking song by the best band ever in the world in their most creative years in the greatest album of all time!!!|||A Day in the Life I read the news today oh, boy, About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad, well I just had to laugh, I saw the photograph He blew his mind out in a car, He didn't notice that the lights had changed,A crowd of people stood and stared, They'd seen his face before,Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of LordsI saw a film today oh, boy, The English army had just won the warA crowd of people turned away,But I just had to look, having read the book,I love to turn you on.Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, and looking up, I noticed I was late Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, somebody spoke and I went into a dream,  ah  I read the news today oh, boy, Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire And though the holes were rather small, They had to count them all Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall, I'd love to turn you on|||77,33

n|||jam hot|||The moment you come across a Jamhot, the first thing that comes to your mind is his/her friendly nature. He is what he seems to be. Qualities like subtlety, diplomacy or modesty just don't gel with a Jamhot named person. A Jamhot can be calm, wise and serious, but not before he has gone past youth. Frankness, lack of stability, fear of physical pain, optimism and impulsiveness are some of the basic Jamhot characteristics. One of the warmest and the most generous people, Jamhots always prefer fame to money. Gossip does not interest a Jamhot and for him, people are either black or white, without any shades of grey. There is one thing an Jamhot can never fall short of, conversation. He can speak about anything & everything under the sun. He lives in the present and is a realist, yet believes in miracles. Jamhots chase success, not waiting for it to fall in their lap, and don't accept defeat. Failure can never keep them down.Most of the Jamhot people are involved in business or creative arts or are involved in planning and organization. If a Jamhot does something for you, don't forget to express your gratitude. Otherwise, he will be deeply hurt. However, that would not stop him from helping again. Jamhots usually stick to their opinion and won't listen to anything they do not believe. They have a contemplative side to their personality. The simplicity is blended with the blind passion of a born crusader. Jamhots are mentally strong and always one of the pioneers.|||Jamhot - EntropiaUniverse - Real Life - Everywhere - The Entertainer|||1,1

UltraSoft was featured in books like 'BBS Secrets" from IDG Publishing and others, and in BBS Related articles and on a number of software CDs. A few of the Door Games they produced were Top Ranked Boxing, Animated Backgammon, and Saratoga Raceway. There is also a Drag Strip Game and a High-Speed Indianapolis Oval Track Racing Game.  Since that time they still upgrade their doorgames for BBS systems on Telnet, but also produce a variety of shareware programs for other platforms, such as Windows 95 up through Vista.
